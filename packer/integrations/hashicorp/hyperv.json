The\nresult of the Hyper-V builder is a directory containing all the files\nnecessary to run the virtual machine portably.\n\n## Basic Examples\n\nHere are some basic examples. Neither example would really do anything more\nthan producing a copy of the source virtual machine. However, the examples\ncould be used as a starting point for more advanced templates.\n\nImport from folder:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"type\": \"hyperv-vmcx\",\n  \"clone_from_vmcx_path\": \"c:/path/to/ubuntu-12.04.5-server-amd64\",\n  \"ssh_username\": \"packer\",\n  \"ssh_password\": \"packer\",\n  \"shutdown_command\": \"echo 'packer' | sudo -S shutdown -P now\"\n}\n```\n\nClone from existing virtual machine:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"clone_from_vm_name\": \"ubuntu-12.04.5-server-amd64\",\n  \"shutdown_command\": \"echo 'packer' | sudo -S shutdown -P now\",\n  \"ssh_password\": \"packer\",\n  \"ssh_username\": \"packer\",\n  \"type\": \"hyperv-vmcx\"\n}\n```\n\nBy default Packer will perform a hard power off of a virtual machine.\nHowever, when a machine is powered off this way, it is possible that\nchanges made to the VMs file system may not be fully synced, possibly\nleading to corruption of files or lost changes. As such, it is important to\nadd a `shutdown_command`. This tells Packer how to safely shutdown and\npower off the VM.\n\n## Configuration Reference\n\nThere are many configuration options available for the Hyper-V builder. They\nare organized below into two categories: required and optional. Within each\ncategory, the available options are alphabetized and described.\n\nIn addition to the options listed here, a\n[communicator](/packer/docs/templates/legacy_json_templates/communicator) can be configured for this\nbuilder.\n\n## ISO Configuration Reference\n\n<!-- Code generated from the comments of the ISOConfig struct in multistep/commonsteps/iso_config.go; DO NOT EDIT MANUALLY -->\n\nBy default, Packer will symlink, download or copy image files to the Packer\ncache into a \"`hash($iso_url+$iso_checksum).$iso_target_extension`\" file.\nPacker uses [hashicorp/go-getter](https://github.com/hashicorp/go-getter) in\nfile mode in order to perform a download.\n\ngo-getter supports the following protocols:\n\n* Local files\n* Git\n* Mercurial\n* HTTP\n* Amazon S3\n\nExamples:\ngo-getter can guess the checksum type based on `iso_checksum` length, and it is\nalso possible to specify the checksum type.\n\nIn JSON:\n\n```json\n\n\t\"iso_checksum\": \"946a6077af6f5f95a51f82fdc44051c7aa19f9cfc5f737954845a6050543d7c2\",\n\t\"iso_url\": \"ubuntu.org/.../ubuntu-14.04.1-server-amd64.iso\"\n\n```\n\n```json\n\n\t\"iso_checksum\": \"file:ubuntu.org/..../ubuntu-14.04.1-server-amd64.iso.sum\",\n\t\"iso_url\": \"ubuntu.org/.../ubuntu-14.04.1-server-amd64.iso\"\n\n```\n\n```json\n\n\t\"iso_checksum\": \"file://./shasums.txt\",\n\t\"iso_url\": \"ubuntu.org/.../ubuntu-14.04.1-server-amd64.iso\"\n\n```\n\n```json\n\n\t\"iso_checksum\": \"file:./shasums.txt\",\n\t\"iso_url\": \"ubuntu.org/.../ubuntu-14.04.1-server-amd64.iso\"\n\n```\n\nIn HCL2:\n\n```hcl\n\n\tiso_checksum = \"946a6077af6f5f95a51f82fdc44051c7aa19f9cfc5f737954845a6050543d7c2\"\n\tiso_url = \"ubuntu.org/.../ubuntu-14.04.1-server-amd64.iso\"\n\n```\n\n```hcl\n\n\tiso_checksum = \"file:ubuntu.org/..../ubuntu-14.04.1-server-amd64.iso.sum\"\n\tiso_url = \"ubuntu.org/.../ubuntu-14.04.1-server-amd64.iso\"\n\n```\n\n```hcl\n\n\tiso_checksum = \"file://./shasums.txt\"\n\tiso_url = \"ubuntu.org/.../ubuntu-14.04.1-server-amd64.iso\"\n\n```\n\n```hcl\n\n\tiso_checksum = \"file:./shasums.txt\",\n\tiso_url = \"ubuntu.org/.../ubuntu-14.04.1-server-amd64.iso\"\n\n```\n\n<!-- End of code generated from the comments of the ISOConfig struct in multistep/commonsteps/iso_config.go; -->\n\n\n### Required:\n\n<!-- Code generated from the comments of the ISOConfig struct in multistep/commonsteps/iso_config.go; DO NOT EDIT MANUALLY -->\n\n- `iso_checksum` (string) - The checksum for the ISO file or virtual hard drive file. The type of\n  the checksum is specified within the checksum field as a prefix, ex:\n  \"md5:{$checksum}\". The type of the checksum can also be omitted and\n  Packer will try to infer it based on string length. Valid values are\n  \"none\", \"{$checksum}\", \"md5:{$checksum}\", \"sha1:{$checksum}\",\n  \"sha256:{$checksum}\", \"sha512:{$checksum}\" or \"file:{$path}\". Here is a\n  list of valid checksum values:\n   * md5:090992ba9fd140077b0661cb75f7ce13\n   * 090992ba9fd140077b0661cb75f7ce13\n   * sha1:ebfb681885ddf1234c18094a45bbeafd91467911\n   * ebfb681885ddf1234c18094a45bbeafd91467911\n   * sha256:ed363350696a726b7932db864dda019bd2017365c9e299627830f06954643f93\n   * ed363350696a726b7932db864dda019bd2017365c9e299627830f06954643f93\n   * file:http://releases.ubuntu.com/20.04/SHA256SUMS\n   * file:file://./local/path/file.sum\n   * file:./local/path/file.sum\n   * none\n  Although the checksum will not be verified when it is set to \"none\",\n  this is not recommended since these files can be very large and\n  corruption does happen from time to time.\n\n- `iso_url` (string) - A URL to the ISO containing the installation image or virtual hard drive\n  (VHD or VHDX) file to clone.\n\n<!-- End of code generated from the comments of the ISOConfig struct in multistep/commonsteps/iso_config.go; -->\n\n\n**Optional:**\n\n<!-- Code generated from the comments of the ISOConfig struct in multistep/commonsteps/iso_config.go; DO NOT EDIT MANUALLY -->\n\n- `iso_urls` ([]string) - Multiple URLs for the ISO to download. Packer will try these in order.\n  If anything goes wrong attempting to download or while downloading a\n  single URL, it will move on to the next. All URLs must point to the same\n  file (same checksum). By default this is empty and `iso_url` is used.\n  Only one of `iso_url` or `iso_urls` can be specified.\n\n- `iso_target_path` (string) - The path where the iso should be saved after download. By default will\n  go in the packer cache, with a hash of the original filename and\n  checksum as its name.\n\n- `iso_target_extension` (string) - The extension of the iso file after download. This defaults to `iso`.\n\n<!-- End of code generated from the comments of the ISOConfig struct in multistep/commonsteps/iso_config.go; -->\n\n\n### Required for virtual machine import:\n\n- `clone_from_vmcx_path` (string) - The path to a directory containing a\n  previously exported virtual machine. The exported machine will be used\n  as the source for new VM.\n\n  note: You should provide the named directory that contains the\n  \"Virtual Machines\", \"Snapshots\", and/or \"Virtual Hard Disks\" subdirectories,\n  not the .vmcx file itself.\n\n### Required for virtual machine clone:\n\n- `clone_from_vm_name` (string) - The name of the VM to clone from. Ideally\n  the machine to clone from should be shutdown.\n\n**Optional:**\n\n<!-- Code generated from the comments of the Config struct in builder/hyperv/vmcx/builder.go; DO NOT EDIT MANUALLY -->\n\n- `disable_shutdown` (bool) - Packer normally halts the virtual machine after all provisioners have\n  run when no `shutdown_command` is defined. If this is set to `true`, Packer\n  *will not* halt the virtual machine but will assume that the VM will shut itself down\n  when it's done, via the preseed.cfg or your final provisioner.\n  Packer will wait for a default of 5 minutes until the virtual machine is shutdown.\n  The timeout can be changed using the `shutdown_timeout` option.\n\n- `disk_size` (\\*uint) - The size, in megabytes, of the primary hard disk\n  for the VM. By default, this is the same as the cloned VM.\n\n- `clone_from_vmcx_path` (string) - This is the path to a directory containing an exported virtual machine.\n\n- `clone_from_vm_name` (string) - This is the name of the virtual machine to clone from.\n\n- `clone_from_snapshot_name` (string) - The name of a snapshot in the\n  source machine to use as a starting point for the clone. If the value\n  given is an empty string, the last snapshot present in the source will\n  be chosen as the starting point for the new VM.\n\n- `clone_all_snapshots` (bool) - If set to true all snapshots\n  present in the source machine will be copied when the machine is\n  cloned. The final result of the build will be an exported virtual\n  machine that contains all the snapshots of the parent.\n\n- `differencing_disk` (bool) - If true enables differencing disks. Only\n  the changes will be written to the new disk. This is especially useful if\n  your source is a VHD/VHDX. This defaults to false.\n\n- `copy_in_compare` (bool) - When cloning a vm to build from, we run a powershell\n  Compare-VM command, which, depending on your version of Windows, may need\n  the \"Copy\" flag to be set to true or false. Defaults to \"false\". Command:\n\n<!-- End of code generated from the comments of the Config struct in builder/hyperv/vmcx/builder.go; -->\n\n\n<!-- Code generated from the comments of the CommonConfig struct in builder/hyperv/common/config.go; DO NOT EDIT MANUALLY -->\n\n- `disk_block_size` (uint) - The block size of the VHD to be created.\n  Recommended disk block size for Linux hyper-v guests is 1 MiB. This\n  defaults to \"32\" MiB.\n\n- `memory` (uint) - The amount, in megabytes, of RAM to assign to the\n  VM. By default, this is 1 GB.\n\n- `secondary_iso_images` ([]string) - A list of ISO paths to\n  attach to a VM when it is booted. This is most useful for unattended\n  Windows installs, which look for an Autounattend.xml file on removable\n  media. By default, no secondary ISO will be attached.\n\n- `disk_additional_size` ([]uint) - The size or sizes of any\n  additional hard disks for the VM in megabytes. If this is not specified\n  then the VM will only contain a primary hard disk. Additional drives\n  will be attached to the SCSI interface only. The builder uses\n  expandable rather than fixed-size virtual hard disks, so the actual\n  file representing the disk will not use the full size unless it is\n  full.\n\n- `guest_additions_mode` (string) - If set to attach then attach and\n  mount the ISO image specified in guest_additions_path. If set to\n  none then guest additions are not attached and mounted; This is the\n  default.\n\n- `guest_additions_path` (string) - The path to the ISO image for guest\n  additions.\n\n- `vm_name` (string) - This is the name of the new virtual machine,\n  without the file extension. By default this is \"packer-BUILDNAME\",\n  where \"BUILDNAME\" is the name of the build.\n\n- `switch_name` (string) - The name of the switch to connect the virtual\n  machine to. By default, leaving this value unset will cause Packer to\n  try and determine the switch to use by looking for an external switch\n  that is up and running.\n\n- `switch_vlan_id` (string) - This is the VLAN of the virtual switch's\n  network card. By default none is set. If none is set then a VLAN is not\n  set on the switch's network card. If this value is set it should match\n  the VLAN specified in by vlan_id.\n\n- `mac_address` (string) - This allows a specific MAC address to be used on\n  the default virtual network card. The MAC address must be a string with\n  no delimiters, for example \"0000deadbeef\".\n\n- `vlan_id` (string) - This is the VLAN of the virtual machine's network\n  card for the new virtual machine. By default none is set. If none is set\n  then VLANs are not set on the virtual machine's network card.\n\n- `cpus` (uint) - The number of CPUs the virtual machine should use. If\n  this isn't specified, the default is 1 CPU.\n\n- `generation` (uint) - The Hyper-V generation for the virtual machine. By\n  default, this is 1. Generation 2 Hyper-V virtual machines do not support\n  floppy drives. In this scenario use secondary_iso_images instead. Hard\n  drives and DVD drives will also be SCSI and not IDE.\n\n- `enable_mac_spoofing` (bool) - If true enable MAC address spoofing\n  for the virtual machine. This defaults to false.\n\n- `enable_dynamic_memory` (bool) - If true enable dynamic memory for\n  the virtual machine. This defaults to false.\n\n- `enable_secure_boot` (bool) - If true enable secure boot for the\n  virtual machine. This defaults to false. See secure_boot_template\n  below for additional settings.\n\n- `secure_boot_template` (string) - The secure boot template to be\n  configured. Valid values are \"MicrosoftWindows\" (Windows) or\n  \"MicrosoftUEFICertificateAuthority\" (Linux). This only takes effect if\n  enable_secure_boot is set to \"true\". This defaults to \"MicrosoftWindows\".\n\n- `enable_virtualization_extensions` (bool) - If true enable\n  virtualization extensions for the virtual machine. This defaults to\n  false. For nested virtualization you need to enable MAC spoofing,\n  disable dynamic memory and have at least 4GB of RAM assigned to the\n  virtual machine.\n\n- `enable_tpm` (bool) - If true enable a virtual TPM for the\n  virtual machine. This defaults to false.\n\n- `temp_path` (string) - The location under which Packer will create a directory to house all the\n  VM files and folders during the build. By default `%TEMP%` is used\n  which, for most systems, will evaluate to\n  `%USERPROFILE%/AppData/Local/Temp`.\n  \n  The build directory housed under `temp_path` will have a name similar to\n  `packerhv1234567`. The seven digit number at the end of the name is\n  automatically generated by Packer to ensure the directory name is\n  unique.\n\n- `configuration_version` (string) - This allows you to set the vm version when calling New-VM to generate\n  the vm.\n\n- `keep_registered` (bool) - If \"true\", Packer will not delete the VM from\n  The Hyper-V manager.\n\n- `skip_compaction` (bool) - If true skip compacting the hard disk for\n  the virtual machine when exporting. This defaults to false.\n\n- `skip_export` (bool) - If true Packer will skip the export of the VM.\n  If you are interested only in the VHD/VHDX files, you can enable this\n  option. The resulting VHD/VHDX file will be output to\n  <output_directory>/Virtual Hard Disks. By default this option is false\n  and Packer will export the VM to output_directory.\n\n- `headless` (bool) - Packer defaults to building Hyper-V virtual\n  machines by launching a GUI that shows the console of the machine being\n  built. When this value is set to true, the machine will start without a\n  console.\n\n- `first_boot_device` (string) - When configured, determines the device or device type that is given preferential\n  treatment when choosing a boot device.\n  \n  For Generation 1:\n    - `IDE`\n    - `CD` *or* `DVD`\n    - `Floppy`\n    - `NET`\n  \n  For Generation 2:\n    - `IDE:x:y`\n    - `SCSI:x:y`\n    - `CD` *or* `DVD`\n    - `NET`\n\n- `boot_order` ([]string) - When configured, the boot order determines the order of the devices\n  from which to boot.\n  \n  The device name must be in the form of `SCSI:x:y`, for example,\n  to boot from the first scsi device use `SCSI:0:0`.\n  \n  **NB** You should also set `first_boot_device` (e.g. `DVD`).\n  \n  **NB** Although the VM will have this initial boot order, the OS can\n  change it, for example, Ubuntu 18.04 will modify the boot order to\n  include itself as the first boot option.\n  \n  **NB** This only works for Generation 2 machines.\n\n<!-- End of code generated from the comments of the CommonConfig struct in builder/hyperv/common/config.go; -->\n\n\n### Communicator configuration reference\n\n<!-- Code generated from the comments of the Config struct in communicator/config.go; DO NOT EDIT MANUALLY -->\n\n- `communicator` (string) - Packer currently supports three kinds of communicators:\n  \n  -   `none` - No communicator will be used. If this is set, most\n      provisioners also can't be used.\n  \n  -   `ssh` - An SSH connection will be established to the machine. This\n      is usually the default.\n  \n  -   `winrm` - A WinRM connection will be established.\n  \n  In addition to the above, some builders have custom communicators they\n  can use. For example, the Docker builder has a \"docker\" communicator\n  that uses `docker exec` and `docker cp` to execute scripts and copy\n  files.\n\n- `pause_before_connecting` (duration string | ex: \"1h5m2s\") - We recommend that you enable SSH or WinRM as the very last step in your\n  guest's bootstrap script, but sometimes you may have a race condition\n  where you need Packer to wait before attempting to connect to your\n  guest.\n  \n  If you end up in this situation, you can use the template option\n  `pause_before_connecting`. By default, there is no pause. For example if\n  you set `pause_before_connecting` to `10m` Packer will check whether it\n  can connect, as normal. But once a connection attempt is successful, it\n  will disconnect and then wait 10 minutes before connecting to the guest\n  and beginning provisioning.\n\n<!-- End of code generated from the comments of the Config struct in communicator/config.go; -->\n\n\n#### SSH fields:\n\n<!-- Code generated from the comments of the SSH struct in communicator/config.go; DO NOT EDIT MANUALLY -->\n\n- `ssh_host` (string) - The address to SSH to. This usually is automatically configured by the\n  builder.\n\n- `ssh_port` (int) - The port to connect to SSH. This defaults to `22`.\n\n- `ssh_username` (string) - The username to connect to SSH with. Required if using SSH.\n\n- `ssh_password` (string) - A plaintext password to use to authenticate with SSH.\n\n- `ssh_ciphers` ([]string) - This overrides the value of ciphers supported by default by Golang.\n  The default value is [\n    \"aes128-gcm@openssh.com\",\n    \"chacha20-poly1305@openssh.com\",\n    \"aes128-ctr\", \"aes192-ctr\", \"aes256-ctr\",\n  ]\n  \n  Valid options for ciphers include:\n  \"aes128-ctr\", \"aes192-ctr\", \"aes256-ctr\", \"aes128-gcm@openssh.com\",\n  \"chacha20-poly1305@openssh.com\",\n  \"arcfour256\", \"arcfour128\", \"arcfour\", \"aes128-cbc\", \"3des-cbc\",\n\n- `ssh_clear_authorized_keys` (bool) - If true, Packer will attempt to remove its temporary key from\n  `~/.ssh/authorized_keys` and `/root/.ssh/authorized_keys`. This is a\n  mostly cosmetic option, since Packer will delete the temporary private\n  key from the host system regardless of whether this is set to true\n  (unless the user has set the `-debug` flag). Defaults to \"false\";\n  currently only works on guests with `sed` installed.\n\n- `ssh_key_exchange_algorithms` ([]string) - If set, Packer will override the value of key exchange (kex) algorithms\n  supported by default by Golang. Acceptable values include:\n  \"curve25519-sha256@libssh.org\", \"ecdh-sha2-nistp256\",\n  \"ecdh-sha2-nistp384\", \"ecdh-sha2-nistp521\",\n  \"diffie-hellman-group14-sha1\", and \"diffie-hellman-group1-sha1\".\n\n- `ssh_certificate_file` (string) - Path to user certificate used to authenticate with SSH.\n  The `~` can be used in path and will be expanded to the\n  home directory of current user.\n\n- `ssh_pty` (bool) - If `true`, a PTY will be requested for the SSH connection. This defaults\n  to `false`.\n\n- `ssh_timeout` (duration string | ex: \"1h5m2s\") - The time to wait for SSH to become available. Packer uses this to\n  determine when the machine has booted so this is usually quite long.\n  Example value: `10m`.\n  This defaults to `5m`, unless `ssh_handshake_attempts` is set.\n\n- `ssh_disable_agent_forwarding` (bool) - If true, SSH agent forwarding will be disabled. Defaults to `false`.\n\n- `ssh_handshake_attempts` (int) - The number of handshakes to attempt with SSH once it can connect.\n  This defaults to `10`, unless a `ssh_timeout` is set.\n\n- `ssh_bastion_host` (string) - A bastion host to use for the actual SSH connection.\n\n- `ssh_bastion_port` (int) - The port of the bastion host. Defaults to `22`.\n\n- `ssh_bastion_agent_auth` (bool) - If `true`, the local SSH agent will be used to authenticate with the\n  bastion host. Defaults to `false`.\n\n- `ssh_bastion_username` (string) - The username to connect to the bastion host.\n\n- `ssh_bastion_password` (string) - The password to use to authenticate with the bastion host.\n\n- `ssh_bastion_interactive` (bool) - If `true`, the keyboard-interactive used to authenticate with bastion host.\n\n- `ssh_bastion_private_key_file` (string) - Path to a PEM encoded private key file to use to authenticate with the\n  bastion host. The `~` can be used in path and will be expanded to the\n  home directory of current user.\n\n- `ssh_bastion_certificate_file` (string) - Path to user certificate used to authenticate with bastion host.\n  The `~` can be used in path and will be expanded to the\n  home directory of current user.\n\n- `ssh_file_transfer_method` (string) - `scp` or `sftp` - How to transfer files, Secure copy (default) or SSH\n  File Transfer Protocol.\n  \n  **NOTE**: Guests using Windows with Win32-OpenSSH v9.1.0.0p1-Beta, scp\n  (the default protocol for copying data) returns a a non-zero error code since the MOTW\n  cannot be set, which cause any file transfer to fail. As a workaround you can override the transfer protocol\n  with SFTP instead `ssh_file_transfer_protocol = \"sftp\"`.\n\n- `ssh_proxy_host` (string) - A SOCKS proxy host to use for SSH connection\n\n- `ssh_proxy_port` (int) - A port of the SOCKS proxy. Defaults to `1080`.\n\n- `ssh_proxy_username` (string) - The optional username to authenticate with the proxy server.\n\n- `ssh_proxy_password` (string) - The optional password to use to authenticate with the proxy server.\n\n- `ssh_keep_alive_interval` (duration string | ex: \"1h5m2s\") - How often to send \"keep alive\" messages to the server. Set to a negative\n  value (`-1s`) to disable. Example value: `10s`. Defaults to `5s`.\n\n- `ssh_read_write_timeout` (duration string | ex: \"1h5m2s\") - The amount of time to wait for a remote command to end. This might be\n  useful if, for example, packer hangs on a connection after a reboot.\n  Example: `5m`. Disabled by default.\n\n- `ssh_remote_tunnels` ([]string) - \n\n- `ssh_local_tunnels` ([]string) - \n\n<!-- End of code generated from the comments of the SSH struct in communicator/config.go; -->\n\n\n- `ssh_private_key_file` (string) - Path to a PEM encoded private key file to use to authenticate with SSH.\n  The `~` can be used in path and will be expanded to the home directory\n  of current user.\n\n\n#### WinRM fields:\n\n<!-- Code generated from the comments of the WinRM struct in communicator/config.go; DO NOT EDIT MANUALLY -->\n\n- `winrm_username` (string) - The username to use to connect to WinRM.\n\n- `winrm_password` (string) - The password to use to connect to WinRM.\n\n- `winrm_host` (string) - The address for WinRM to connect to.\n  \n  NOTE: If using an Amazon EBS builder, you can specify the interface\n  WinRM connects to via\n  [`ssh_interface`](/packer/integrations/hashicorp/amazon/latest/components/builder/ebs#ssh_interface)\n\n- `winrm_no_proxy` (bool) - Setting this to `true` adds the remote\n  `host:port` to the `NO_PROXY` environment variable. This has the effect of\n  bypassing any configured proxies when connecting to the remote host.\n  Default to `false`.\n\n- `winrm_port` (int) - The WinRM port to connect to. This defaults to `5985` for plain\n  unencrypted connection and `5986` for SSL when `winrm_use_ssl` is set to\n  true.\n\n- `winrm_timeout` (duration string | ex: \"1h5m2s\") - The amount of time to wait for WinRM to become available. This defaults\n  to `30m` since setting up a Windows machine generally takes a long time.\n\n- `winrm_use_ssl` (bool) - If `true`, use HTTPS for WinRM.\n\n- `winrm_insecure` (bool) - If `true`, do not check server certificate chain and host name.\n\n- `winrm_use_ntlm` (bool) - If `true`, NTLMv2 authentication (with session security) will be used\n  for WinRM, rather than default (basic authentication), removing the\n  requirement for basic authentication to be enabled within the target\n  guest. Further reading for remote connection authentication can be found\n  [here](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa384295(v=vs.85).aspx).\n\n<!-- End of code generated from the comments of the WinRM struct in communicator/config.go; -->\n\n\n### CD configuration\n\n<!-- Code generated from the comments of the CDConfig struct in multistep/commonsteps/extra_iso_config.go; DO NOT EDIT MANUALLY -->\n\nAn iso (CD) containing custom files can be made available for your build.\n\nBy default, no extra CD will be attached. All files listed in this setting\nget placed into the root directory of the CD and the CD is attached as the\nsecond CD device.\n\nThis config exists to work around modern operating systems that have no\nway to mount floppy disks, which was our previous go-to for adding files at\nboot time.\n\n<!-- End of code generated from the comments of the CDConfig struct in multistep/commonsteps/extra_iso_config.go; -->\n\n\n**Optional:**\n\n<!-- Code generated from the comments of the CDConfig struct in multistep/commonsteps/extra_iso_config.go; DO NOT EDIT MANUALLY -->\n\n- `cd_files` ([]string) - A list of files to place onto a CD that is attached when the VM is\n  booted. This can include either files or directories; any directories\n  will be copied onto the CD recursively, preserving directory structure\n  hierarchy. Symlinks will have the link's target copied into the directory\n  tree on the CD where the symlink was. File globbing is allowed.\n  \n  Usage example (JSON):\n  \n  ```json\n  \"cd_files\": [\"./somedirectory/meta-data\", \"./somedirectory/user-data\"],\n  \"cd_label\": \"cidata\",\n  ```\n  \n  Usage example (HCL):\n  \n  ```hcl\n  cd_files = [\"./somedirectory/meta-data\", \"./somedirectory/user-data\"]\n  cd_label = \"cidata\"\n  ```\n  \n  The above will create a CD with two files, user-data and meta-data in the\n  CD root. This specific example is how you would create a CD that can be\n  used for an Ubuntu 20.04 autoinstall.\n  \n  Since globbing is also supported,\n  \n  ```hcl\n  cd_files = [\"./somedirectory/*\"]\n  cd_label = \"cidata\"\n  ```\n  \n  Would also be an acceptable way to define the above cd. The difference\n  between providing the directory with or without the glob is whether the\n  directory itself or its contents will be at the CD root.\n  \n  Use of this option assumes that you have a command line tool installed\n  that can handle the iso creation. Packer will use one of the following\n  tools:\n  \n    * xorriso\n    * mkisofs\n    * hdiutil (normally found in macOS)\n    * oscdimg (normally found in Windows as part of the Windows ADK)\n\n- `cd_content` (map[string]string) - Key/Values to add to the CD. The keys represent the paths, and the values\n  contents. It can be used alongside `cd_files`, which is useful to add large\n  files without loading them into memory. If any paths are specified by both,\n  the contents in `cd_content` will take precedence.\n  \n  Usage example (HCL):\n  \n  ```hcl\n  cd_files = [\"vendor-data\"]\n  cd_content = {\n    \"meta-data\" = jsonencode(local.instance_data)\n    \"user-data\" = templatefile(\"user-data\", { packages = [\"nginx\"] })\n  }\n  cd_label = \"cidata\"\n  ```\n\n- `cd_label` (string) - CD Label\n\n<!-- End of code generated from the comments of the CDConfig struct in multistep/commonsteps/extra_iso_config.go; -->\n\n\n### Boot Command\n\nThe `boot_command` configuration is very important: it specifies the keys to\ntype when the virtual machine is first booted in order to start the OS\ninstaller. This command is typed after `boot_wait`, which gives the virtual\nmachine some time to actually load the ISO.\n\nAs documented above, the `boot_command` is an array of strings. The strings\nare all typed in sequence. It is an array only to improve readability within\nthe template.\n\nThe boot command is \"typed\" character for character over the virtual keyboard\nto the machine, simulating a human actually typing the keyboard.\n\nThere are a set of special keys available. If these are in your boot\ncommand, they will be replaced by the proper key:\n\n- `<bs>` - Backspace\n\n- `<del>` - Delete\n\n- `<enter> <return>` - Simulates an actual \"enter\" or \"return\" keypress.\n\n- `<esc>` - Simulates pressing the escape key.\n\n- `<tab>` - Simulates pressing the tab key.\n\n- `<f1> - <f12>` - Simulates pressing a function key.\n\n- `<up> <down> <left> <right>` - Simulates pressing an arrow key.\n\n- `<spacebar>` - Simulates pressing the spacebar.\n\n- `<insert>` - Simulates pressing the insert key.\n\n- `<home> <end>` - Simulates pressing the home and end keys.\n\n- `<pageUp> <pageDown>` - Simulates pressing the page up and page down keys.\n\n- `<menu>` - Simulates pressing the Menu key.\n\n- `<leftAlt> <rightAlt>` - Simulates pressing the alt key.\n\n- `<leftCtrl> <rightCtrl>` - Simulates pressing the ctrl key.\n\n- `<leftShift> <rightShift>` - Simulates pressing the shift key.\n\n- `<leftSuper> <rightSuper>` - Simulates pressing the ⌘ or Windows key.\n\n- `<wait> <wait5> <wait10>` - Adds a 1, 5 or 10 second pause before\n  sending any additional keys. This is useful if you have to generally wait\n  for the UI to update before typing more.\n\n- `<waitXX>` - Add an arbitrary pause before sending any additional keys. The\n  format of `XX` is a sequence of positive decimal numbers, each with\n  optional fraction and a unit suffix, such as `300ms`, `1.5h` or `2h45m`.\n  Valid time units are `ns`, `us` (or `µs`), `ms`, `s`, `m`, `h`. For example\n  `<wait10m>` or `<wait1m20s>`\n\n### On/Off variants\n\nAny printable keyboard character, and of these \"special\" expressions, with the\nexception of the `<wait>` types, can also be toggled on or off. For example, to\nsimulate ctrl+c, use `<leftCtrlOn>c<leftCtrlOff>`. Be sure to release them,\notherwise they will be held down until the machine reboots.\n\nTo hold the `c` key down, you would use `<cOn>`. Likewise, `<cOff>` to release.\n\n### Templates inside boot command\n\nIn addition to the special keys, each command to type is treated as a\n[template engine](/packer/docs/templates/legacy_json_templates/engine). The\navailable variables are:\n\n- `HTTPIP` and `HTTPPort` - The IP and port, respectively of an HTTP server\n  that is started serving the directory specified by the `http_directory`\n  configuration parameter or the content specified in the `http_content` map. If\n  `http_directory` or `http_content` isn't specified, these will be blank!\n- `Name` - The name of the VM.\n\nFor more examples of various boot commands, see the sample projects from our\n[community templates page](/community-tools#templates).\ncommand.mdx'\n\nThe example shown below is a working boot command used to start an Ubuntu\n12.04 installer:\n\n```json\n[\n  \"<esc><esc><enter><wait>\",\n  \"/install/vmlinuz noapic \",\n  \"preseed/url=http://{{ .HTTPIP }}:{{ .HTTPPort }}/preseed.cfg \",\n  \"debian-installer=en_US auto locale=en_US kbd-chooser/method=us \",\n  \"hostname={{ .Name }} \",\n  \"fb=false debconf/frontend=noninteractive \",\n  \"keyboard-configuration/modelcode=SKIP keyboard-configuration/layout=USA \",\n  \"keyboard-configuration/variant=USA console-setup/ask_detect=false \",\n  \"initrd=/install/initrd.gz -- <enter>\"\n]\n```\n\nFor more examples of various boot commands, see the sample projects from our\n[community templates page](/community-tools#templates).\n\n### HTTP directory configuration\n\n<!-- Code generated from the comments of the HTTPConfig struct in multistep/commonsteps/http_config.go; DO NOT EDIT MANUALLY -->\n\nPacker will create an http server serving `http_directory` when it is set, a\nrandom free port will be selected and the architecture of the directory\nreferenced will be available in your builder.\n\nExample usage from a builder:\n\n```\nwget http://{{ .HTTPIP }}:{{ .HTTPPort }}/foo/bar/preseed.cfg\n```\n\n<!-- End of code generated from the comments of the HTTPConfig struct in multistep/commonsteps/http_config.go; -->\n\n\n**Optional:**\n\n<!-- Code generated from the comments of the HTTPConfig struct in multistep/commonsteps/http_config.go; DO NOT EDIT MANUALLY -->\n\n- `http_directory` (string) - Path to a directory to serve using an HTTP server. The files in this\n  directory will be available over HTTP that will be requestable from the\n  virtual machine. This is useful for hosting kickstart files and so on.\n  By default this is an empty string, which means no HTTP server will be\n  started. The address and port of the HTTP server will be available as\n  variables in `boot_command`. This is covered in more detail below.\n\n- `http_content` (map[string]string) - Key/Values to serve using an HTTP server. `http_content` works like and\n  conflicts with `http_directory`. The keys represent the paths and the\n  values contents, the keys must start with a slash, ex: `/path/to/file`.\n  `http_content` is useful for hosting kickstart files and so on. By\n  default this is empty, which means no HTTP server will be started. The\n  address and port of the HTTP server will be available as variables in\n  `boot_command`. This is covered in more detail below.\n  Example:\n  ```hcl\n    http_content = {\n      \"/a/b\"     = file(\"http/b\")\n      \"/foo/bar\" = templatefile(\"${path.root}/preseed.cfg\", { packages = [\"nginx\"] })\n    }\n  ```\n\n- `http_port_min` (int) - These are the minimum and maximum port to use for the HTTP server\n  started to serve the `http_directory`. Because Packer often runs in\n  parallel, Packer will choose a randomly available port in this range to\n  run the HTTP server. If you want to force the HTTP server to be on one\n  port, make this minimum and maximum port the same. By default the values\n  are `8000` and `9000`, respectively.\n\n- `http_port_max` (int) - HTTP Port Max\n\n- `http_bind_address` (string) - This is the bind address for the HTTP server. Defaults to 0.0.0.0 so that\n  it will work with any network interface.\n\n<!-- End of code generated from the comments of the HTTPConfig struct in multistep/commonsteps/http_config.go; -->\n\n\n## Integration Services\n\nPacker will automatically attach the integration services ISO as a DVD drive\nfor the version of Hyper-V that is running.\n\n## Generation 1 vs Generation 2\n\nFloppy drives are no longer supported by generation 2 machines. This requires\nyou to take another approach when dealing with preseed or answer files. Two\npossible options are using the `cd_files` option or using Packer's built in web\nserver.\n\nWhen dealing with Windows you need to enable UEFI drives for generation 2\nvirtual machines.\n\n## Creating an ISO From a Directory\n\nPrograms like mkisofs can be used to create an ISO from a directory. There is\na [windows version of\nmkisofs](http://opensourcepack.blogspot.co.uk/p/cdrtools.html) available.\n\nBelow is a working PowerShell script that can be used to create a Windows\nanswer ISO:\n\n```powershell\n$isoFolder = \"answer-iso\"\nif (test-path $isoFolder){\n  remove-item $isoFolder -Force -Recurse\n}\n\nif (test-path windows\\windows-2012R2-serverdatacenter-amd64\\answer.iso){\n  remove-item windows\\windows-2012R2-serverdatacenter-amd64\\answer.iso -Force\n}\n\nmkdir $isoFolder\n\ncopy

Typically, the VM is booted, an OS is installed, and software is\nprovisioned within the OS. Finally the VM is shut down. The result of the\nHyper-V builder is a directory containing all the files necessary to run\nthe virtual machine portably.\n\n## Basic Example\n\nHere is a basic example. This example is not functional. It will start the OS\ninstaller but then fail because we don't provide the preseed file for Ubuntu\nto self-install. Still, the example serves to show the basic configuration:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"type\": \"hyperv-iso\",\n  \"iso_url\": \"http://releases.ubuntu.com/12.04/ubuntu-12.04.5-server-amd64.iso\",\n  \"iso_checksum\": \"md5:769474248a3897f4865817446f9a4a53\",\n  \"ssh_username\": \"packer\",\n  \"ssh_password\": \"packer\",\n  \"shutdown_command\": \"echo 'packer' | sudo -S shutdown -P now\"\n}\n```\n\nBy default Packer will perform a hard power off of a virtual machine.\nHowever, when a machine is powered off this way, it is possible that\nchanges made to the VMs file system may not be fully synced, possibly\nleading to corruption of files or lost changes. As such, it is important to\nadd a `shutdown_command`. This tells Packer how to safely shutdown and\npower off the VM.\n\n## Configuration Reference\n\nThere are many configuration options available for the Hyper-V builder. They\nare organized below into two categories: required and optional. Within each\ncategory, the available options are alphabetized and described.\n\nIn addition to the options listed here, a\n[communicator](/packer/docs/templates/legacy_json_templates/communicator) can be configured for this\nbuilder.\n\n### ISO Configuration Reference\n\n<!-- Code generated from the comments of the ISOConfig struct in multistep/commonsteps/iso_config.go; DO NOT EDIT MANUALLY -->\n\nBy default, Packer will symlink, download or copy image files to the Packer\ncache into a \"`hash($iso_url+$iso_checksum).$iso_target_extension`\" file.\nPacker uses [hashicorp/go-getter](https://github.com/hashicorp/go-getter) in\nfile mode in order to perform a download.\n\ngo-getter supports the following protocols:\n\n* Local files\n* Git\n* Mercurial\n* HTTP\n* Amazon S3\n\nExamples:\ngo-getter can guess the checksum type based on `iso_checksum` length, and it is\nalso possible to specify the checksum type.\n\nIn JSON:\n\n```json\n\n\t\"iso_checksum\": \"946a6077af6f5f95a51f82fdc44051c7aa19f9cfc5f737954845a6050543d7c2\",\n\t\"iso_url\": \"ubuntu.org/.../ubuntu-14.04.1-server-amd64.iso\"\n\n```\n\n```json\n\n\t\"iso_checksum\": \"file:ubuntu.org/..../ubuntu-14.04.1-server-amd64.iso.sum\",\n\t\"iso_url\": \"ubuntu.org/.../ubuntu-14.04.1-server-amd64.iso\"\n\n```\n\n```json\n\n\t\"iso_checksum\": \"file://./shasums.txt\",\n\t\"iso_url\": \"ubuntu.org/.../ubuntu-14.04.1-server-amd64.iso\"\n\n```\n\n```json\n\n\t\"iso_checksum\": \"file:./shasums.txt\",\n\t\"iso_url\": \"ubuntu.org/.../ubuntu-14.04.1-server-amd64.iso\"\n\n```\n\nIn HCL2:\n\n```hcl\n\n\tiso_checksum = \"946a6077af6f5f95a51f82fdc44051c7aa19f9cfc5f737954845a6050543d7c2\"\n\tiso_url = \"ubuntu.org/.../ubuntu-14.04.1-server-amd64.iso\"\n\n```\n\n```hcl\n\n\tiso_checksum = \"file:ubuntu.org/..../ubuntu-14.04.1-server-amd64.iso.sum\"\n\tiso_url = \"ubuntu.org/.../ubuntu-14.04.1-server-amd64.iso\"\n\n```\n\n```hcl\n\n\tiso_checksum = \"file://./shasums.txt\"\n\tiso_url = \"ubuntu.org/.../ubuntu-14.04.1-server-amd64.iso\"\n\n```\n\n```hcl\n\n\tiso_checksum = \"file:./shasums.txt\",\n\tiso_url = \"ubuntu.org/.../ubuntu-14.04.1-server-amd64.iso\"\n\n```\n\n<!-- End of code generated from the comments of the ISOConfig struct in multistep/commonsteps/iso_config.go; -->\n\n\n\n<!-- Code generated from the comments of the ISOConfig struct in multistep/commonsteps/iso_config.go; DO NOT EDIT MANUALLY -->\n\n- `iso_checksum` (string) - The checksum for the ISO file or virtual hard drive file.

Valid values are\n  \"none\", \"{$checksum}\", \"md5:{$checksum}\", \"sha1:{$checksum}\",\n  \"sha256:{$checksum}\", \"sha512:{$checksum}\" or \"file:{$path}\". Here is a\n  list of valid checksum values:\n   * md5:090992ba9fd140077b0661cb75f7ce13\n   * 090992ba9fd140077b0661cb75f7ce13\n   * sha1:ebfb681885ddf1234c18094a45bbeafd91467911\n   * ebfb681885ddf1234c18094a45bbeafd91467911\n   * sha256:ed363350696a726b7932db864dda019bd2017365c9e299627830f06954643f93\n   * ed363350696a726b7932db864dda019bd2017365c9e299627830f06954643f93\n   * file:http://releases.ubuntu.com/20.04/SHA256SUMS\n   * file:file://./local/path/file.sum\n   * file:./local/path/file.sum\n   * none\n  Although the checksum will not be verified when it is set to \"none\",\n  this is not recommended since these files can be very large and\n  corruption does happen from time to time.\n\n- `iso_url` (string) - A URL to the ISO containing the installation image or virtual hard drive\n  (VHD or VHDX) file to clone.\n\n<!-- End of code generated from the comments of the ISOConfig struct in multistep/commonsteps/iso_config.go; -->\n\n\n**Optional:**\n\n<!-- Code generated from the comments of the ISOConfig struct in multistep/commonsteps/iso_config.go; DO NOT EDIT MANUALLY -->\n\n- `iso_urls` ([]string) - Multiple URLs for the ISO to download. Packer will try these in order.\n  If anything goes wrong attempting to download or while downloading a\n  single URL, it will move on to the next. All URLs must point to the same\n  file (same checksum). By default this is empty and `iso_url` is used.\n  Only one of `iso_url` or `iso_urls` can be specified.\n\n- `iso_target_path` (string) - The path where the iso should be saved after download. By default will\n  go in the packer cache, with a hash of the original filename and\n  checksum as its name.\n\n- `iso_target_extension` (string) - The extension of the iso file after download. This defaults to `iso`.\n\n<!-- End of code generated from the comments of the ISOConfig struct in multistep/commonsteps/iso_config.go; -->\n\n\n- `output_directory` (string) - This setting specifies the directory that\nartifacts from the build, such as the virtual machine files and disks,\nwill be output to. The path to the directory may be relative or\nabsolute. If relative, the path is relative to the working directory\n`packer` is executed from. This directory must not exist or, if\ncreated, must be empty prior to running the builder. By default this is\n\"output-BUILDNAME\" where \"BUILDNAME\" is the name of the build.\n\n<!-- Code generated from the comments of the Config struct in builder/hyperv/iso/builder.go; DO NOT EDIT MANUALLY -->\n\n- `disable_shutdown` (bool) - Packer normally halts the virtual machine after all provisioners have\n  run when no `shutdown_command` is defined. If this is set to `true`, Packer\n  *will not* halt the virtual machine but will assume that the VM will shut itself down\n  when it's done, via the preseed.cfg or your final provisioner.\n  Packer will wait for a default of 5 minutes until the virtual machine is shutdown.\n  The timeout can be changed using the `shutdown_timeout` option.\n\n- `disk_size` (uint) - The size, in megabytes, of the hard disk to create\n  for the VM. By default, this is 40 GB.\n\n- `use_legacy_network_adapter` (bool) - If true use a legacy network adapter as the NIC.\n  This defaults to false. A legacy network adapter is fully emulated NIC, and is thus\n  supported by various exotic operating systems, but this emulation requires\n  additional overhead and should only be used if absolutely necessary.\n\n- `differencing_disk` (bool) - If true enables differencing disks. Only\n  the changes will be written to the new disk. This is especially useful if\n  your source is a VHD/VHDX. This defaults to false.\n\n- `use_fixed_vhd_format` (bool) - If true, creates the boot disk on the\n  virtual machine as a fixed VHD format disk. The default is false, which\n  creates a dynamic VHDX format disk. This option requires setting\n  generation to 1, skip_compaction to true, and\n  differencing_disk to false. Additionally, any value entered for\n  disk_block_size will be ignored. The most likely use case for this\n  option is outputing a disk that is in the format required for upload to\n  Azure.\n\n<!-- End of code generated from the comments of the Config struct in builder/hyperv/iso/builder.go; -->\n\n\n<!-- Code generated from the comments of the CommonConfig struct in builder/hyperv/common/config.go; DO NOT EDIT MANUALLY -->\n\n- `disk_block_size` (uint) - The block size of the VHD to be created.\n  Recommended disk block size for Linux hyper-v guests is 1 MiB. This\n  defaults to \"32\" MiB.\n\n- `memory` (uint) - The amount, in megabytes, of RAM to assign to the\n  VM. By default, this is 1 GB.\n\n- `secondary_iso_images` ([]string) - A list of ISO paths to\n  attach to a VM when it is booted. This is most useful for unattended\n  Windows installs, which look for an Autounattend.xml file on removable\n  media. By default, no secondary ISO will be attached.\n\n- `disk_additional_size` ([]uint) - The size or sizes of any\n  additional hard disks for the VM in megabytes. If this is not specified\n  then the VM will only contain a primary hard disk. Additional drives\n  will be attached to the SCSI interface only. The builder uses\n  expandable rather than fixed-size virtual hard disks, so the actual\n  file representing the disk will not use the full size unless it is\n  full.\n\n- `guest_additions_mode` (string) - If set to attach then attach and\n  mount the ISO image specified in guest_additions_path. If set to\n  none then guest additions are not attached and mounted; This is the\n  default.\n\n- `guest_additions_path` (string) - The path to the ISO image for guest\n  additions.\n\n- `vm_name` (string) - This is the name of the new virtual machine,\n  without the file extension. By default this is \"packer-BUILDNAME\",\n  where \"BUILDNAME\" is the name of the build.\n\n- `switch_name` (string) - The name of the switch to connect the virtual\n  machine to. By default, leaving this value unset will cause Packer to\n  try and determine the switch to use by looking for an external switch\n  that is up and running.\n\n- `switch_vlan_id` (string) - This is the VLAN of the virtual switch's\n  network card. By default none is set. If none is set then a VLAN is not\n  set on the switch's network card. If this value is set it should match\n  the VLAN specified in by vlan_id.\n\n- `mac_address` (string) - This allows a specific MAC address to be used on\n  the default virtual network card. The MAC address must be a string with\n  no delimiters, for example \"0000deadbeef\".\n\n- `vlan_id` (string) - This is the VLAN of the virtual machine's network\n  card for the new virtual machine. By default none is set. If none is set\n  then VLANs are not set on the virtual machine's network card.\n\n- `cpus` (uint) - The number of CPUs the virtual machine should use. If\n  this isn't specified, the default is 1 CPU.\n\n- `generation` (uint) - The Hyper-V generation for the virtual machine. By\n  default, this is 1. Generation 2 Hyper-V virtual machines do not support\n  floppy drives. In this scenario use secondary_iso_images instead. Hard\n  drives and DVD drives will also be SCSI and not IDE.\n\n- `enable_mac_spoofing` (bool) - If true enable MAC address spoofing\n  for the virtual machine. This defaults to false.\n\n- `enable_dynamic_memory` (bool) - If true enable dynamic memory for\n  the virtual machine. This defaults to false.\n\n- `enable_secure_boot` (bool) - If true enable secure boot for the\n  virtual machine. This defaults to false. See secure_boot_template\n  below for additional settings.\n\n- `secure_boot_template` (string) - The secure boot template to be\n  configured. Valid values are \"MicrosoftWindows\" (Windows) or\n  \"MicrosoftUEFICertificateAuthority\" (Linux). This only takes effect if\n  enable_secure_boot is set to \"true\". This defaults to \"MicrosoftWindows\".\n\n- `enable_virtualization_extensions` (bool) - If true enable\n  virtualization extensions for the virtual machine. This defaults to\n  false. For nested virtualization you need to enable MAC spoofing,\n  disable dynamic memory and have at least 4GB of RAM assigned to the\n  virtual machine.\n\n- `enable_tpm` (bool) - If true enable a virtual TPM for the\n  virtual machine. This defaults to false.\n\n- `temp_path` (string) - The location under which Packer will create a directory to house all the\n  VM files and folders during the build. By default `%TEMP%` is used\n  which, for most systems, will evaluate to\n  `%USERPROFILE%/AppData/Local/Temp`.\n  \n  The build directory housed under `temp_path` will have a name similar to\n  `packerhv1234567`. The seven digit number at the end of the name is\n  automatically generated by Packer to ensure the directory name is\n  unique.\n\n- `configuration_version` (string) - This allows you to set the vm version when calling New-VM to generate\n  the vm.\n\n- `keep_registered` (bool) - If \"true\", Packer will not delete the VM from\n  The Hyper-V manager.\n\n- `skip_compaction` (bool) - If true skip compacting the hard disk for\n  the virtual machine when exporting. This defaults to false.\n\n- `skip_export` (bool) - If true Packer will skip the export of the VM.\n  If you are interested only in the VHD/VHDX files, you can enable this\n  option. The resulting VHD/VHDX file will be output to\n  <output_directory>/Virtual Hard Disks. By default this option is false\n  and Packer will export the VM to output_directory.\n\n- `headless` (bool) - Packer defaults to building Hyper-V virtual\n  machines by launching a GUI that shows the console of the machine being\n  built. When this value is set to true, the machine will start without a\n  console.\n\n- `first_boot_device` (string) - When configured, determines the device or device type that is given preferential\n  treatment when choosing a boot device.\n  \n  For Generation 1:\n    - `IDE`\n    - `CD` *or* `DVD`\n    - `Floppy`\n    - `NET`\n  \n  For Generation 2:\n    - `IDE:x:y`\n    - `SCSI:x:y`\n    - `CD` *or* `DVD`\n    - `NET`\n\n- `boot_order` ([]string) - When configured, the boot order determines the order of the devices\n  from which to boot.\n  \n  The device name must be in the form of `SCSI:x:y`, for example,\n  to boot from the first scsi device use `SCSI:0:0`.\n  \n  **NB** You should also set `first_boot_device` (e.g. `DVD`).\n  \n  **NB** Although the VM will have this initial boot order, the OS can\n  change it, for example, Ubuntu 18.04 will modify the boot order to\n  include itself as the first boot option.\n  \n  **NB** This only works for Generation 2 machines.\n\n<!-- End of code generated from the comments of the CommonConfig struct in builder/hyperv/common/config.go; -->\n\n\n### HTTP Directory configuration\n\n<!-- Code generated from the comments of the HTTPConfig struct in multistep/commonsteps/http_config.go; DO NOT EDIT MANUALLY -->\n\nPacker will create an http server serving `http_directory` when it is set, a\nrandom free port will be selected and the architecture of the directory\nreferenced will be available in your builder.\n\nExample usage from a builder:\n\n```\nwget http://{{ .HTTPIP }}:{{ .HTTPPort }}/foo/bar/preseed.cfg\n```\n\n<!-- End of code generated from the comments of the HTTPConfig struct in multistep/commonsteps/http_config.go; -->\n\n\n**Optional:**\n\n<!-- Code generated from the comments of the HTTPConfig struct in multistep/commonsteps/http_config.go; DO NOT EDIT MANUALLY -->\n\n- `http_directory` (string) - Path to a directory to serve using an HTTP server. The files in this\n  directory will be available over HTTP that will be requestable from the\n  virtual machine. This is useful for hosting kickstart files and so on.\n  By default this is an empty string, which means no HTTP server will be\n  started. The address and port of the HTTP server will be available as\n  variables in `boot_command`. This is covered in more detail below.\n\n- `http_content` (map[string]string) - Key/Values to serve using an HTTP server. `http_content` works like and\n  conflicts with `http_directory`. The keys represent the paths and the\n  values contents, the keys must start with a slash, ex: `/path/to/file`.\n  `http_content` is useful for hosting kickstart files and so on. By\n  default this is empty, which means no HTTP server will be started. The\n  address and port of the HTTP server will be available as variables in\n  `boot_command`. This is covered in more detail below.\n  Example:\n  ```hcl\n    http_content = {\n      \"/a/b\"     = file(\"http/b\")\n      \"/foo/bar\" = templatefile(\"${path.root}/preseed.cfg\", { packages = [\"nginx\"] })\n    }\n  ```\n\n- `http_port_min` (int) - These are the minimum and maximum port to use for the HTTP server\n  started to serve the `http_directory`. Because Packer often runs in\n  parallel, Packer will choose a randomly available port in this range to\n  run the HTTP server. If you want to force the HTTP server to be on one\n  port, make this minimum and maximum port the same. By default the values\n  are `8000` and `9000`, respectively.\n\n- `http_port_max` (int) - HTTP Port Max\n\n- `http_bind_address` (string) - This is the bind address for the HTTP server. Defaults to 0.0.0.0 so that\n  it will work with any network interface.\n\n<!-- End of code generated from the comments of the HTTPConfig struct in multistep/commonsteps/http_config.go; -->\n\n\n### Shutdown configuration reference\n\n<!-- Code generated from the comments of the ShutdownConfig struct in shutdowncommand/config.go; DO NOT EDIT MANUALLY -->\n\n- `shutdown_command` (string) - The command to use to gracefully shut down the machine once all\n  provisioning is complete. By default this is an empty string, which\n  tells Packer to just forcefully shut down the machine. This setting can\n  be safely omitted if for example, a shutdown command to gracefully halt\n  the machine is configured inside a provisioning script. If one or more\n  scripts require a reboot it is suggested to leave this blank (since\n  reboots may fail) and instead specify the final shutdown command in your\n  last script.\n\n- `shutdown_timeout` (duration string | ex: \"1h5m2s\") - The amount of time to wait after executing the shutdown_command for the\n  virtual machine to actually shut down. If the machine doesn't shut down\n  in this time it is considered an error. By default, the time out is \"5m\"\n  (five minutes).\n\n<!-- End of code generated from the comments of the ShutdownConfig struct in shutdowncommand/config.go; -->\n\n\n### Floppy configuration reference\n\n<!-- Code generated from the comments of the FloppyConfig struct in multistep/commonsteps/floppy_config.go; DO NOT EDIT MANUALLY -->\n\nA floppy can be made available for your build. This is most useful for\nunattended Windows installs, which look for an Autounattend.xml file on\nremovable media. By default, no floppy will be attached. All files listed in\nthis setting get placed into the root directory of the floppy and the floppy\nis attached as the first floppy device. The summary size of the listed files\nmust not exceed 1.44 MB. The supported ways to move large files into the OS\nare using `http_directory` or [the file\nprovisioner](/packer/docs/provisioner/file).\n\n<!-- End of code generated from the comments of the FloppyConfig struct in multistep/commonsteps/floppy_config.go; -->\n\n\n**Optional:**\n\n<!-- Code generated from the comments of the FloppyConfig struct in multistep/commonsteps/floppy_config.go; DO NOT EDIT MANUALLY -->\n\n- `floppy_files` ([]string) - A list of files to place onto a floppy disk that is attached when the VM\n  is booted. Currently, no support exists for creating sub-directories on\n  the floppy. Wildcard characters (\\\\*, ?, and \\[\\]) are allowed. Directory\n  names are also allowed, which will add all the files found in the\n  directory to the floppy.\n\n- `floppy_dirs` ([]string) - A list of directories to place onto the floppy disk recursively. This is\n  similar to the `floppy_files` option except that the directory structure\n  is preserved. This is useful for when your floppy disk includes drivers\n  or if you just want to organize it's contents as a hierarchy. Wildcard\n  characters (\\\\*, ?, and \\[\\]) are allowed. The maximum summary size of\n  all files in the listed directories are the same as in `floppy_files`.\n\n- `floppy_content` (map[string]string) - Key/Values to add to the floppy disk. The keys represent the paths, and\n  the values contents. It can be used alongside `floppy_files` or\n  `floppy_dirs`, which is useful to add large files without loading them\n  into memory. If any paths are specified by both, the contents in\n  `floppy_content` will take precedence.\n  \n  Usage example (HCL):\n  \n  ```hcl\n  floppy_files = [\"vendor-data\"]\n  floppy_content = {\n    \"meta-data\" = jsonencode(local.instance_data)\n    \"user-data\" = templatefile(\"user-data\", { packages = [\"nginx\"] })\n  }\n  floppy_label = \"cidata\"\n  ```\n\n- `floppy_label` (string) - Floppy Label\n\n<!-- End of code generated from the comments of the FloppyConfig struct in multistep/commonsteps/floppy_config.go; -->\n\n\n#### CD configuration reference\n\n<!-- Code generated from the comments of the CDConfig struct in multistep/commonsteps/extra_iso_config.go; DO NOT EDIT MANUALLY -->\n\n- `cd_files` ([]string) - A list of files to place onto a CD that is attached when the VM is\n  booted. This can include either files or directories; any directories\n  will be copied onto the CD recursively, preserving directory structure\n  hierarchy. Symlinks will have the link's target copied into the directory\n  tree on the CD where the symlink was. File globbing is allowed.\n  \n  Usage example (JSON):\n  \n  ```json\n  \"cd_files\": [\"./somedirectory/meta-data\", \"./somedirectory/user-data\"],\n  \"cd_label\": \"cidata\",\n  ```\n  \n  Usage example (HCL):\n  \n  ```hcl\n  cd_files = [\"./somedirectory/meta-data\", \"./somedirectory/user-data\"]\n  cd_label = \"cidata\"\n  ```\n  \n  The above will create a CD with two files, user-data and meta-data in the\n  CD root. This specific example is how you would create a CD that can be\n  used for an Ubuntu 20.04 autoinstall.\n  \n  Since globbing is also supported,\n  \n  ```hcl\n  cd_files = [\"./somedirectory/*\"]\n  cd_label = \"cidata\"\n  ```\n  \n  Would also be an acceptable way to define the above cd. The difference\n  between providing the directory with or without the glob is whether the\n  directory itself or its contents will be at the CD root.\n  \n  Use of this option assumes that you have a command line tool installed\n  that can handle the iso creation. Packer will use one of the following\n  tools:\n  \n    * xorriso\n    * mkisofs\n    * hdiutil (normally found in macOS)\n    * oscdimg (normally found in Windows as part of the Windows ADK)\n\n- `cd_content` (map[string]string) - Key/Values to add to the CD. The keys represent the paths, and the values\n  contents. It can be used alongside `cd_files`, which is useful to add large\n  files without loading them into memory. If any paths are specified by both,\n  the contents in `cd_content` will take precedence.\n  \n  Usage example (HCL):\n  \n  ```hcl\n  cd_files = [\"vendor-data\"]\n  cd_content = {\n    \"meta-data\" = jsonencode(local.instance_data)\n    \"user-data\" = templatefile(\"user-data\", { packages = [\"nginx\"] })\n  }\n  cd_label = \"cidata\"\n  ```\n\n- `cd_label` (string) - CD Label\n\n<!-- End of code generated from the comments of the CDConfig struct in multistep/commonsteps/extra_iso_config.go; -->\n\n\n### Communicator configuration reference\n\n#### Optional common fields:\n\n<!-- Code generated from the comments of the Config struct in communicator/config.go; DO NOT EDIT MANUALLY -->\n\n- `communicator` (string) - Packer currently supports three kinds of communicators:\n  \n  -   `none` - No communicator will be used. If this is set, most\n      provisioners also can't be used.\n  \n  -   `ssh` - An SSH connection will be established to the machine. This\n      is usually the default.\n  \n  -   `winrm` - A WinRM connection will be established.\n  \n  In addition to the above, some builders have custom communicators they\n  can use. For example, the Docker builder has a \"docker\" communicator\n  that uses `docker exec` and `docker cp` to execute scripts and copy\n  files.\n\n- `pause_before_connecting` (duration string | ex: \"1h5m2s\") - We recommend that you enable SSH or WinRM as the very last step in your\n  guest's bootstrap script, but sometimes you may have a race condition\n  where you need Packer to wait before attempting to connect to your\n  guest.\n  \n  If you end up in this situation, you can use the template option\n  `pause_before_connecting`. By default, there is no pause. For example if\n  you set `pause_before_connecting` to `10m` Packer will check whether it\n  can connect, as normal. But once a connection attempt is successful, it\n  will disconnect and then wait 10 minutes before connecting to the guest\n  and beginning provisioning.\n\n<!-- End of code generated from the comments of the Config struct in communicator/config.go; -->\n\n\n### Optional SSH fields:\n\n<!-- Code generated from the comments of the SSH struct in communicator/config.go; DO NOT EDIT MANUALLY -->\n\n- `ssh_host` (string) - The address to SSH to. This usually is automatically configured by the\n  builder.\n\n- `ssh_port` (int) - The port to connect to SSH. This defaults to `22`.\n\n- `ssh_username` (string) - The username to connect to SSH with. Required if using SSH.\n\n- `ssh_password` (string) - A plaintext password to use to authenticate with SSH.\n\n- `ssh_ciphers` ([]string) - This overrides the value of ciphers supported by default by Golang.\n  The default value is [\n    \"aes128-gcm@openssh.com\",\n    \"chacha20-poly1305@openssh.com\",\n    \"aes128-ctr\", \"aes192-ctr\", \"aes256-ctr\",\n  ]\n  \n  Valid options for ciphers include:\n  \"aes128-ctr\", \"aes192-ctr\", \"aes256-ctr\", \"aes128-gcm@openssh.com\",\n  \"chacha20-poly1305@openssh.com\",\n  \"arcfour256\", \"arcfour128\", \"arcfour\", \"aes128-cbc\", \"3des-cbc\",\n\n- `ssh_clear_authorized_keys` (bool) - If true, Packer will attempt to remove its temporary key from\n  `~/.ssh/authorized_keys` and `/root/.ssh/authorized_keys`. This is a\n  mostly cosmetic option, since Packer will delete the temporary private\n  key from the host system regardless of whether this is set to true\n  (unless the user has set the `-debug` flag). Defaults to \"false\";\n  currently only works on guests with `sed` installed.\n\n- `ssh_key_exchange_algorithms` ([]string) - If set, Packer will override the value of key exchange (kex) algorithms\n  supported by default by Golang. Acceptable values include:\n  \"curve25519-sha256@libssh.org\", \"ecdh-sha2-nistp256\",\n  \"ecdh-sha2-nistp384\", \"ecdh-sha2-nistp521\",\n  \"diffie-hellman-group14-sha1\", and \"diffie-hellman-group1-sha1\".\n\n- `ssh_certificate_file` (string) - Path to user certificate used to authenticate with SSH.\n  The `~` can be used in path and will be expanded to the\n  home directory of current user.\n\n- `ssh_pty` (bool) - If `true`, a PTY will be requested for the SSH connection. This defaults\n  to `false`.\n\n- `ssh_timeout` (duration string | ex: \"1h5m2s\") - The time to wait for SSH to become available. Packer uses this to\n  determine when the machine has booted so this is usually quite long.\n  Example value: `10m`.\n  This defaults to `5m`, unless `ssh_handshake_attempts` is set.\n\n- `ssh_disable_agent_forwarding` (bool) - If true, SSH agent forwarding will be disabled. Defaults to `false`.\n\n- `ssh_handshake_attempts` (int) - The number of handshakes to attempt with SSH once it can connect.\n  This defaults to `10`, unless a `ssh_timeout` is set.\n\n- `ssh_bastion_host` (string) - A bastion host to use for the actual SSH connection.\n\n- `ssh_bastion_port` (int) - The port of the bastion host. Defaults to `22`.\n\n- `ssh_bastion_agent_auth` (bool) - If `true`, the local SSH agent will be used to authenticate with the\n  bastion host. Defaults to `false`.\n\n- `ssh_bastion_username` (string) - The username to connect to the bastion host.\n\n- `ssh_bastion_password` (string) - The password to use to authenticate with the bastion host.\n\n- `ssh_bastion_interactive` (bool) - If `true`, the keyboard-interactive used to authenticate with bastion host.\n\n- `ssh_bastion_private_key_file` (string) - Path to a PEM encoded private key file to use to authenticate with the\n  bastion host. The `~` can be used in path and will be expanded to the\n  home directory of current user.\n\n- `ssh_bastion_certificate_file` (string) - Path to user certificate used to authenticate with bastion host.\n  The `~` can be used in path and will be expanded to the\n  home directory of current user.\n\n- `ssh_file_transfer_method` (string) - `scp` or `sftp` - How to transfer files, Secure copy (default) or SSH\n  File Transfer Protocol.\n  \n  **NOTE**: Guests using Windows with Win32-OpenSSH v9.1.0.0p1-Beta, scp\n  (the default protocol for copying data) returns a a non-zero error code since the MOTW\n  cannot be set, which cause any file transfer to fail. As a workaround you can override the transfer protocol\n  with SFTP instead `ssh_file_transfer_protocol = \"sftp\"`.\n\n- `ssh_proxy_host` (string) - A SOCKS proxy host to use for SSH connection\n\n- `ssh_proxy_port` (int) - A port of the SOCKS proxy. Defaults to `1080`.\n\n- `ssh_proxy_username` (string) - The optional username to authenticate with the proxy server.\n\n- `ssh_proxy_password` (string) - The optional password to use to authenticate with the proxy server.\n\n- `ssh_keep_alive_interval` (duration string | ex: \"1h5m2s\") - How often to send \"keep alive\" messages to the server.

Defaults to `5s`.\n\n- `ssh_read_write_timeout` (duration string | ex: \"1h5m2s\") - The amount of time to wait for a remote command to end. This might be\n  useful if, for example, packer hangs on a connection after a reboot.\n  Example: `5m`. Disabled by default.\n\n- `ssh_remote_tunnels` ([]string) - \n\n- `ssh_local_tunnels` ([]string) - \n\n<!-- End of code generated from the comments of the SSH struct in communicator/config.go; -->\n\n\n- `ssh_private_key_file` (string) - Path to a PEM encoded private key file to use to authenticate with SSH.\n  The `~` can be used in path and will be expanded to the home directory\n  of current user.\n\n\n#### Optional WinRM fields:\n\n<!-- Code generated from the comments of the WinRM struct in communicator/config.go; DO NOT EDIT MANUALLY -->\n\n- `winrm_username` (string) - The username to use to connect to WinRM.\n\n- `winrm_password` (string) - The password to use to connect to WinRM.\n\n- `winrm_host` (string) - The address for WinRM to connect to.\n  \n  NOTE: If using an Amazon EBS builder, you can specify the interface\n  WinRM connects to via\n  [`ssh_interface`](/packer/integrations/hashicorp/amazon/latest/components/builder/ebs#ssh_interface)\n\n- `winrm_no_proxy` (bool) - Setting this to `true` adds the remote\n  `host:port` to the `NO_PROXY` environment variable. This has the effect of\n  bypassing any configured proxies when connecting to the remote host.\n  Default to `false`.\n\n- `winrm_port` (int) - The WinRM port to connect to. This defaults to `5985` for plain\n  unencrypted connection and `5986` for SSL when `winrm_use_ssl` is set to\n  true.\n\n- `winrm_timeout` (duration string | ex: \"1h5m2s\") - The amount of time to wait for WinRM to become available. This defaults\n  to `30m` since setting up a Windows machine generally takes a long time.\n\n- `winrm_use_ssl` (bool) - If `true`, use HTTPS for WinRM.\n\n- `winrm_insecure` (bool) - If `true`, do not check server certificate chain and host name.\n\n- `winrm_use_ntlm` (bool) - If `true`, NTLMv2 authentication (with session security) will be used\n  for WinRM, rather than default (basic authentication), removing the\n  requirement for basic authentication to be enabled within the target\n  guest. Further reading for remote connection authentication can be found\n  [here](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa384295(v=vs.85).aspx).\n\n<!-- End of code generated from the comments of the WinRM struct in communicator/config.go; -->\n\n\n### Boot Configuration Reference\n\n<!-- Code generated from the comments of the BootConfig struct in bootcommand/config.go; DO NOT EDIT MANUALLY -->\n\nThe boot configuration is very important: `boot_command` specifies the keys\nto type when the virtual machine is first booted in order to start the OS\ninstaller. This command is typed after boot_wait, which gives the virtual\nmachine some time to actually load.\n\nThe boot_command is an array of strings. The strings are all typed in\nsequence. It is an array only to improve readability within the template.\n\nThere are a set of special keys available. If these are in your boot\ncommand, they will be replaced by the proper key:\n\n-   `<bs>` - Backspace\n\n-   `<del>` - Delete\n\n-   `<enter> <return>` - Simulates an actual \"enter\" or \"return\" keypress.\n\n-   `<esc>` - Simulates pressing the escape key.\n\n-   `<tab>` - Simulates pressing the tab key.\n\n-   `<f1> - <f12>` - Simulates pressing a function key.\n\n-   `<up> <down> <left> <right>` - Simulates pressing an arrow key.\n\n-   `<spacebar>` - Simulates pressing the spacebar.\n\n-   `<insert>` - Simulates pressing the insert key.\n\n-   `<home> <end>` - Simulates pressing the home and end keys.\n\n  - `<pageUp> <pageDown>` - Simulates pressing the page up and page down\n    keys.\n\n-   `<menu>` - Simulates pressing the Menu key.\n\n-   `<leftAlt> <rightAlt>` - Simulates pressing the alt key.\n\n-   `<leftCtrl> <rightCtrl>` - Simulates pressing the ctrl key.\n\n-   `<leftShift> <rightShift>` - Simulates pressing the shift key.\n\n-   `<leftSuper> <rightSuper>` - Simulates pressing the ⌘ or Windows key.\n\n  - `<wait> <wait5> <wait10>` - Adds a 1, 5 or 10 second pause before\n    sending any additional keys. This is useful if you have to generally\n    wait for the UI to update before typing more.\n\n  - `<waitXX>` - Add an arbitrary pause before sending any additional keys.\n    The format of `XX` is a sequence of positive decimal numbers, each with\n    optional fraction and a unit suffix, such as `300ms`, `1.5h` or `2h45m`.\n    Valid time units are `ns`, `us` (or `µs`), `ms`, `s`, `m`, `h`. For\n    example `<wait10m>` or `<wait1m20s>`.\n\n  - `<XXXOn> <XXXOff>` - Any printable keyboard character, and of these\n    \"special\" expressions, with the exception of the `<wait>` types, can\n    also be toggled on or off. For example, to simulate ctrl+c, use\n    `<leftCtrlOn>c<leftCtrlOff>`. Be sure to release them, otherwise they\n    will be held down until the machine reboots. To hold the `c` key down,\n    you would use `<cOn>`. Likewise, `<cOff>` to release.\n\n  - `{{ .HTTPIP }} {{ .HTTPPort }}` - The IP and port, respectively of an\n    HTTP server that is started serving the directory specified by the\n    `http_directory` configuration parameter. If `http_directory` isn't\n    specified, these will be blank!\n\n-   `{{ .Name }}` - The name of the VM.\n\nExample boot command. This is actually a working boot command used to start an\nCentOS 6.4 installer:\n\nIn JSON:\n\n```json\n\"boot_command\": [\n\n\t   \"<tab><wait>\",\n\t   \" ks=http://{{ .HTTPIP }}:{{ .HTTPPort }}/centos6-ks.cfg<enter>\"\n\t]\n\n```\n\nIn HCL2:\n\n```hcl\nboot_command = [\n\n\t   \"<tab><wait>\",\n\t   \" ks=http://{{ .HTTPIP }}:{{ .HTTPPort }}/centos6-ks.cfg<enter>\"\n\t]\n\n```\n\nThe example shown below is a working boot command used to start an Ubuntu\n12.04 installer:\n\nIn JSON:\n\n```json\n\"boot_command\": [\n\n\t\"<esc><esc><enter><wait>\",\n\t\"/install/vmlinuz noapic \",\n\t\"preseed/url=http://{{ .HTTPIP }}:{{ .HTTPPort }}/preseed.cfg \",\n\t\"debian-installer=en_US auto locale=en_US kbd-chooser/method=us \",\n\t\"hostname={{ .Name }} \",\n\t\"fb=false debconf/frontend=noninteractive \",\n\t\"keyboard-configuration/modelcode=SKIP keyboard-configuration/layout=USA \",\n\t\"keyboard-configuration/variant=USA console-setup/ask_detect=false \",\n\t\"initrd=/install/initrd.gz -- <enter>\"\n\n]\n```\n\nIn HCL2:\n\n```hcl\nboot_command = [\n\n\t\"<esc><esc><enter><wait>\",\n\t\"/install/vmlinuz noapic \",\n\t\"preseed/url=http://{{ .HTTPIP }}:{{ .HTTPPort }}/preseed.cfg \",\n\t\"debian-installer=en_US auto locale=en_US kbd-chooser/method=us \",\n\t\"hostname={{ .Name }} \",\n\t\"fb=false debconf/frontend=noninteractive \",\n\t\"keyboard-configuration/modelcode=SKIP keyboard-configuration/layout=USA \",\n\t\"keyboard-configuration/variant=USA console-setup/ask_detect=false \",\n\t\"initrd=/install/initrd.gz -- <enter>\"\n\n]\n```\n\nFor more examples of various boot commands, see the sample projects from our\n[community templates page](https://packer.io/community-tools#templates).\n\n<!-- End of code generated from the comments of the BootConfig struct in bootcommand/config.go; -->\n\n\n**Optional:**\n\n<!-- Code generated from the comments of the BootConfig struct in bootcommand/config.go; DO NOT EDIT MANUALLY -->\n\n- `boot_keygroup_interval` (duration string | ex: \"1h5m2s\") - Time to wait after sending a group of key pressses. The value of this\n  should be a duration. Examples are `5s` and `1m30s` which will cause\n  Packer to wait five seconds and one minute 30 seconds, respectively. If\n  this isn't specified, a sensible default value is picked depending on\n  the builder type.\n\n- `boot_wait` (duration string | ex: \"1h5m2s\") - The time to wait after booting the initial virtual machine before typing\n  the `boot_command`. The value of this should be a duration. Examples are\n  `5s` and `1m30s` which will cause Packer to wait five seconds and one\n  minute 30 seconds, respectively. If this isn't specified, the default is\n  `10s` or 10 seconds. To set boot_wait to 0s, use a negative number, such\n  as \"-1s\"\n\n- `boot_command` ([]string) - This is an array of commands to type when the virtual machine is first\n  booted. The goal of these commands should be to type just enough to\n  initialize the operating system installer. Special keys can be typed as\n  well, and are covered in the section below on the boot command. If this\n  is not specified, it is assumed the installer will start itself.\n\n<!-- End of code generated from the comments of the BootConfig struct in bootcommand/config.go; -->\n\n\n## Integration Services\n\nPacker will automatically attach the integration services ISO as a DVD drive\nfor the version of Hyper-V that is running.\n\n## Generation 1 vs Generation 2\n\nFloppy drives are no longer supported by generation 2 machines. This requires\nyou to take another approach when dealing with preseed or answer files. Two\npossible options are using your own virtual DVD drives, the cd_files option,\nor using Packer's built in web server.\n\nWhen dealing with Windows you need to enable UEFI drives for generation 2\nvirtual machines.\n\n## Creating an ISO From a Directory\n\nPrograms like mkisofs can be used to create an ISO from a directory. There is\na [windows version of\nmkisofs](http://opensourcepack.blogspot.co.uk/p/cdrtools.html) available.\n\nBelow is a working PowerShell script that can be used to create a Windows\nanswer ISO:\n\n```powershell\n$isoFolder = \"answer-iso\"\nif (test-path $isoFolder){\n  remove-item $isoFolder -Force -Recurse\n}\n\nif (test-path windows\\windows-2012R2-serverdatacenter-amd64\\answer.iso){\n  remove-item windows\\windows-2012R2-serverdatacenter-amd64\\answer.iso -Force\n}\n\nmkdir $isoFolder\n\ncopy

On Debian based\nmachines, you may need `linux-cloud-tools-common` for `hv_kvp_daemon`. Failure\nto do this may cause packer to wait at `Waiting for SSH to become available...`\nbefore eventually timing out.\n\nAlso note that while the operating system is still being installed by a preseed\nfile, it is normal to see `Waiting for SSH/WinRM to be available` and\n`Error getting SSH/WinRM host: No ip address` error messages until the system\nis actually installed and ready to be connected to.\n\nFor more information about the hyper-v daemons and supported distributions, see\nthe Microsoft docs
