Check [documentation](https://cloud.yandex.com/docs/cli/operations/authentication/service-account#auth-as-sa)\nabout how to create SA and its key.\n\n### Authentication Using a Compute Instance Service Account\n\nAuthentication with a Service Account on an instance happens when neither the `token` nor the `service_account_key_file` parameter is set.\nTo get more information about this kind of authentication check [documentaion](https://cloud.yandex.com/docs/compute/operations/vm-connect/auth-inside-vm).\n\n-> **NB** Do not forget to assigne proper roles to Service Account, if you use this type of auth.\n\n## Basic Example\n\n**JSON**\n\n```json\n{\n  \"type\": \"yandex\",\n  \"token\": \"YOUR OAUTH TOKEN\",\n  \"folder_id\": \"YOUR FOLDER ID\",\n  \"source_image_family\": \"ubuntu-1804-lts\",\n  \"ssh_username\": \"ubuntu\",\n  \"use_ipv4_nat\": \"true\"\n}\n```\n\n\n**HCL2**\n\n```\nsource \"yandex\" \"autogenerated_1\" {\n  folder_id           = \"YOUR FOLDER ID\"\n  source_image_family = \"ubuntu-1804-lts\"\n  ssh_username        = \"ubuntu\"\n  token               = \"YOUR OAUTH TOKEN\"\n  use_ipv4_nat        = \"true\"\n}\n\nbuild {\n  sources = [\"source.yandex.autogenerated_1\"]\n\n}\n```\n\n\n## Configuration Reference\n\nConfiguration options are organized below into two categories: required and\noptional. Within each category, the available options are alphabetized and\ndescribed.\n\nIn addition to the options listed here, a [communicator](/packer/docs/templates/legacy_json_templates/communicator)\ncan be configured for this builder. In addition to the options defined there, a private key file\ncan also be supplied to override the typical auto-generated key:\n\n- `ssh_private_key_file` (string) - Path to a PEM encoded private key file to use to authenticate with SSH.\n  The `~` can be used in path and will be expanded to the home directory\n  of current user.\n\n\n### Required:\n\n#### Access\n\n<!-- Code generated from the comments of the AccessConfig struct in builder/yandex/access_config.go; DO NOT EDIT MANUALLY -->\n\n- `token` (string) - [OAuth token](https://cloud.yandex.com/docs/iam/concepts/authorization/oauth-token)\n  or [IAM token](https://cloud.yandex.com/docs/iam/concepts/authorization/iam-token)\n  to use to authenticate to Yandex.Cloud.

After the image build, a temporary VM\nwill be created to export the image as a qcow2 file to\n`s3://packer-export/my-exported-image.qcow2` and\n`s3://packer-export/image-number-two.qcow2`. `keep_input_artifact` is true, so the\nsource Compute image won't be deleted after the export.\n\nIn order for this example to work, the service account associated with builder\nmust have write access to both `s3://packer-export/my-exported-image.qcow2` and\n`s3://packer-export/image-number-two.qcow2` and get permission to modify temporary instance\n(create new disk, attach to instance, etc).\n\n```json\n{\n  \"builders\": [\n    {\n      \"type\": \"yandex\",\n      \"folder_id\": \"b1g8jvfcgmitdrslcn86\",\n      \"subnet_id\": \"e9bp6l8sa4q39yourxzq\",\n      \"zone\": \"ru-central1-a\",\n\n      \"source_image_family\": \"ubuntu-1604-lts\",\n      \"ssh_username\": \"ubuntu\",\n      \"use_ipv4_nat\": true\n    }\n  ],\n  \"post-processors\": [\n    {\n      \"type\": \"yandex-export\",\n      \"folder_id\": \"b1g8jvfcgmitdrslcn86\",\n      \"subnet_id\": \"e9bp6l8sa4q39yourxzq\",\n\n      \"service_account_id\": \"ajeu0363240rrnn7xgen\",\n\n      \"paths\": [\n        \"s3://packer-export-bucket/my-exported-image.qcow2\",\n        \"s3://packer-export-bucket/template-supported-get-{{build `ImageID` }}-right-here.qcow2\"\n      ],\n      \"keep_input_artifact\": true\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n","created_at":"2023-11-28T17:39:18.302Z","updated_at":"2023-11-28T17:39:18.302Z","name":"Yandex Export","slug":"yandex-export","component":{"id":"73965f1c-ad56-4f38-a31b-dc17d08c0ba6","slug":"post-processor","name":"Post-Processor","plural_name":"Post-Processors","product_id":"4c2b00c6-7cc1-4e4c-b596-4ab57e319f21","created_at":"2022-11-09T22:56:31.157Z","updated_at":"2023-07-26T17:26:54.831Z"},"variable_groups":[]},{"id":"68f64bdc-b7f3-4df0-aeb6-ea8dd0b30e14","integration_release_id":"aed314b7-6811-40fd-baf6-20fc9f5e6b00","component_id":"73965f1c-ad56-4f38-a31b-dc17d08c0ba6","readme":"Type: `yandex-import`\nArtifact BuilderId: `packer.post-processor.yandex-import`\n\nThe Yandex.Cloud Compute Image Import post-processor create new Compute Image\nfrom a qcow2 file.
