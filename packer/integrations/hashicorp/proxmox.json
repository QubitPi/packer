The builder takes a virtual\nmachine template, runs any provisioning necessary on the image after launching it,\nthen creates a virtual machine template. This template can then be used as to\ncreate new virtual machines within Proxmox.\n\nDisks specified in a `proxmox-clone` builder configuration will replace disks\nthat are already present on the cloned VM template. If you want to reuse the disks\nof the cloned VM, don't specify disks in your configuration.\n\nThe builder does _not_ manage templates. Once it creates a template, it is up\nto you to use it or delete it.\n\n## Configuration Reference\n\n<!-- Code generated from the comments of the Config struct in builder/proxmox/common/config.go; DO NOT EDIT MANUALLY -->\n\nThere are many configuration options available for the builder. They are\nsegmented below into two categories: required and optional parameters. Within\neach category, the available configuration keys are alphabetized.\n\nYou may also want to take look at the general configuration references for\n[VirtIO RNG device](#virtio-rng-device)\nand [PCI Devices](#pci-devices)\nconfiguration references, which can be found further down the page.\n\nIn addition to the options listed here, a\n[communicator](/packer/docs/templates/legacy_json_templates/communicator) can be configured for this\nbuilder.\n\nIf no communicator is defined, an SSH key is generated for use, and is used\nin the image's Cloud-Init settings for provisioning.\n\n<!-- End of code generated from the comments of the Config struct in builder/proxmox/common/config.go; -->\n\n\n### Required:\n\n<!-- Code generated from the comments of the Config struct in builder/proxmox/clone/config.go; DO NOT EDIT MANUALLY -->\n\n- `clone_vm` (string) - The name of the VM Packer should clone and build from.\n  Either `clone_vm` or `clone_vm_id` must be specifed.\n\n- `clone_vm_id` (int) - The ID of the VM Packer should clone and build from.\n  Proxmox VMIDs are limited to the range 100-999999999.\n  Either `clone_vm` or `clone_vm_id` must be specifed.\n\n<!-- End of code generated from the comments of the Config struct in builder/proxmox/clone/config.go; -->\n\n\n<!-- Code generated from the comments of the CDConfig struct in multistep/commonsteps/extra_iso_config.go; DO NOT EDIT MANUALLY -->\n\nAn iso (CD) containing custom files can be made available for your build.\n\nBy default, no extra CD will be attached. All files listed in this setting\nget placed into the root directory of the CD and the CD is attached as the\nsecond CD device.\n\nThis config exists to work around modern operating systems that have no\nway to mount floppy disks, which was our previous go-to for adding files at\nboot time.\n\n<!-- End of code generated from the comments of the CDConfig struct in multistep/commonsteps/extra_iso_config.go; -->\n\n\n<!-- Code generated from the comments of the CDConfig struct in multistep/commonsteps/extra_iso_config.go; DO NOT EDIT MANUALLY -->\n\n- `cd_files` ([]string) - A list of files to place onto a CD that is attached when the VM is\n  booted. This can include either files or directories; any directories\n  will be copied onto the CD recursively, preserving directory structure\n  hierarchy. Symlinks will have the link's target copied into the directory\n  tree on the CD where the symlink was. File globbing is allowed.\n  \n  Usage example (JSON):\n  \n  ```json\n  \"cd_files\": [\"./somedirectory/meta-data\", \"./somedirectory/user-data\"],\n  \"cd_label\": \"cidata\",\n  ```\n  \n  Usage example (HCL):\n  \n  ```hcl\n  cd_files = [\"./somedirectory/meta-data\", \"./somedirectory/user-data\"]\n  cd_label = \"cidata\"\n  ```\n  \n  The above will create a CD with two files, user-data and meta-data in the\n  CD root. This specific example is how you would create a CD that can be\n  used for an Ubuntu 20.04 autoinstall.\n  \n  Since globbing is also supported,\n  \n  ```hcl\n  cd_files = [\"./somedirectory/*\"]\n  cd_label = \"cidata\"\n  ```\n  \n  Would also be an acceptable way to define the above cd. The difference\n  between providing the directory with or without the glob is whether the\n  directory itself or its contents will be at the CD root.\n  \n  Use of this option assumes that you have a command line tool installed\n  that can handle the iso creation. Packer will use one of the following\n  tools:\n  \n    * xorriso\n    * mkisofs\n    * hdiutil (normally found in macOS)\n    * oscdimg (normally found in Windows as part of the Windows ADK)\n\n- `cd_content` (map[string]string) - Key/Values to add to the CD. The keys represent the paths, and the values\n  contents. It can be used alongside `cd_files`, which is useful to add large\n  files without loading them into memory. If any paths are specified by both,\n  the contents in `cd_content` will take precedence.\n  \n  Usage example (HCL):\n  \n  ```hcl\n  cd_files = [\"vendor-data\"]\n  cd_content = {\n    \"meta-data\" = jsonencode(local.instance_data)\n    \"user-data\" = templatefile(\"user-data\", { packages = [\"nginx\"] })\n  }\n  cd_label = \"cidata\"\n  ```\n\n- `cd_label` (string) - CD Label\n\n<!-- End of code generated from the comments of the CDConfig struct in multistep/commonsteps/extra_iso_config.go; -->\n\n\n### Optional:\n\n<!-- Code generated from the comments of the Config struct in builder/proxmox/common/config.go; DO NOT EDIT MANUALLY -->\n\n- `boot_key_interval` (duration string | ex: \"1h5m2s\") - Boot Key Interval\n\n- `proxmox_url` (string) - URL to the Proxmox API, including the full path,\n  so `https://<server>:<port>/api2/json` for example.\n  Can also be set via the `PROXMOX_URL` environment variable.\n\n- `insecure_skip_tls_verify` (bool) - Skip validating the certificate.\n\n- `username` (string) - Username when authenticating to Proxmox, including\n  the realm.

For example, a graphics card\nor a network adapter. Devices that are mapped into a guest VM are no longer available\non the host. A minimal configuration only requires either the `host` or the `mapping`\nkey to be specifed.\n\nNote: VMs with passed-through devices cannot be migrated.\n\nHCL2 example:\n\n```hcl\n\n\tpci_devices {\n\t  host          = \"0000:0d:00.1\"\n\t  pcie          = false\n\t  device_id     = \"1003\"\n\t  legacy_igd    = false\n\t  mdev          = \"some-model\"\n\t  hide_rombar   = false\n\t  romfile       = \"vbios.bin\"\n\t  sub_device_id = \"\"\n\t  sub_vendor_id = \"\"\n\t  vendor_id     = \"15B3\"\n\t  x_vga         = false\n\t}\n\n```\n\nJSON example:\n\n```json\n\n\t{\n\t  \"pci_devices\": {\n\t    \"host\"          : \"0000:0d:00.1\",\n\t    \"pcie\"          : false,\n\t    \"device_id\"     : \"1003\",\n\t    \"legacy_igd\"    : false,\n\t    \"mdev\"          : \"some-model\",\n\t    \"hide_rombar\"   : false,\n\t    \"romfile\"       : \"vbios.bin\",\n\t    \"sub_device_id\" : \"\",\n\t    \"sub_vendor_id\" : \"\",\n\t    \"vendor_id\"     : \"15B3\",\n\t    \"x_vga\"         : false\n\t  }\n\t}\n\n```\n\n<!-- End of code generated from the comments of the pciDeviceConfig struct in builder/proxmox/common/config.go; -->\n\n\n#### Optional:\n\n<!-- Code generated from the comments of the pciDeviceConfig struct in builder/proxmox/common/config.go; DO NOT EDIT MANUALLY -->\n\n- `host` (string) - The PCI ID of a host’s PCI device or a PCI virtual function. You can us the `lspci` command to list existing PCI devices. Either this or the `mapping` key must be set.\n\n- `device_id` (string) - Override PCI device ID visible to guest.\n\n- `legacy_igd` (bool) - Pass this device in legacy IGD mode, making it the primary and exclusive graphics device in the VM. Requires `pc-i440fx` machine type and VGA set to `none`. Defaults to `false`.\n\n- `mapping` (string) - The ID of a cluster wide mapping.

Defaults to `false`.\n\n<!-- End of code generated from the comments of the pciDeviceConfig struct in builder/proxmox/common/config.go; -->\n\n\n### Boot Command\n\n<!-- Code generated from the comments of the BootConfig struct in bootcommand/config.go; DO NOT EDIT MANUALLY -->\n\nThe boot configuration is very important: `boot_command` specifies the keys\nto type when the virtual machine is first booted in order to start the OS\ninstaller. This command is typed after boot_wait, which gives the virtual\nmachine some time to actually load.\n\nThe boot_command is an array of strings. The strings are all typed in\nsequence. It is an array only to improve readability within the template.\n\nThere are a set of special keys available. If these are in your boot\ncommand, they will be replaced by the proper key:\n\n-   `<bs>` - Backspace\n\n-   `<del>` - Delete\n\n-   `<enter> <return>` - Simulates an actual \"enter\" or \"return\" keypress.\n\n-   `<esc>` - Simulates pressing the escape key.\n\n-   `<tab>` - Simulates pressing the tab key.\n\n-   `<f1> - <f12>` - Simulates pressing a function key.\n\n-   `<up> <down> <left> <right>` - Simulates pressing an arrow key.\n\n-   `<spacebar>` - Simulates pressing the spacebar.\n\n-   `<insert>` - Simulates pressing the insert key.\n\n-   `<home> <end>` - Simulates pressing the home and end keys.\n\n  - `<pageUp> <pageDown>` - Simulates pressing the page up and page down\n    keys.\n\n-   `<menu>` - Simulates pressing the Menu key.\n\n-   `<leftAlt> <rightAlt>` - Simulates pressing the alt key.\n\n-   `<leftCtrl> <rightCtrl>` - Simulates pressing the ctrl key.\n\n-   `<leftShift> <rightShift>` - Simulates pressing the shift key.\n\n-   `<leftSuper> <rightSuper>` - Simulates pressing the ⌘ or Windows key.\n\n  - `<wait> <wait5> <wait10>` - Adds a 1, 5 or 10 second pause before\n    sending any additional keys. This is useful if you have to generally\n    wait for the UI to update before typing more.\n\n  - `<waitXX>` - Add an arbitrary pause before sending any additional keys.\n    The format of `XX` is a sequence of positive decimal numbers, each with\n    optional fraction and a unit suffix, such as `300ms`, `1.5h` or `2h45m`.\n    Valid time units are `ns`, `us` (or `µs`), `ms`, `s`, `m`, `h`. For\n    example `<wait10m>` or `<wait1m20s>`.\n\n  - `<XXXOn> <XXXOff>` - Any printable keyboard character, and of these\n    \"special\" expressions, with the exception of the `<wait>` types, can\n    also be toggled on or off. For example, to simulate ctrl+c, use\n    `<leftCtrlOn>c<leftCtrlOff>`. Be sure to release them, otherwise they\n    will be held down until the machine reboots. To hold the `c` key down,\n    you would use `<cOn>`. Likewise, `<cOff>` to release.\n\n  - `{{ .HTTPIP }} {{ .HTTPPort }}` - The IP and port, respectively of an\n    HTTP server that is started serving the directory specified by the\n    `http_directory` configuration parameter. If `http_directory` isn't\n    specified, these will be blank!\n\n-   `{{ .Name }}` - The name of the VM.\n\nExample boot command. This is actually a working boot command used to start an\nCentOS 6.4 installer:\n\nIn JSON:\n\n```json\n\"boot_command\": [\n\n\t   \"<tab><wait>\",\n\t   \" ks=http://{{ .HTTPIP }}:{{ .HTTPPort }}/centos6-ks.cfg<enter>\"\n\t]\n\n```\n\nIn HCL2:\n\n```hcl\nboot_command = [\n\n\t   \"<tab><wait>\",\n\t   \" ks=http://{{ .HTTPIP }}:{{ .HTTPPort }}/centos6-ks.cfg<enter>\"\n\t]\n\n```\n\nThe example shown below is a working boot command used to start an Ubuntu\n12.04 installer:\n\nIn JSON:\n\n```json\n\"boot_command\": [\n\n\t\"<esc><esc><enter><wait>\",\n\t\"/install/vmlinuz noapic \",\n\t\"preseed/url=http://{{ .HTTPIP }}:{{ .HTTPPort }}/preseed.cfg \",\n\t\"debian-installer=en_US auto locale=en_US kbd-chooser/method=us \",\n\t\"hostname={{ .Name }} \",\n\t\"fb=false debconf/frontend=noninteractive \",\n\t\"keyboard-configuration/modelcode=SKIP keyboard-configuration/layout=USA \",\n\t\"keyboard-configuration/variant=USA console-setup/ask_detect=false \",\n\t\"initrd=/install/initrd.gz -- <enter>\"\n\n]\n```\n\nIn HCL2:\n\n```hcl\nboot_command = [\n\n\t\"<esc><esc><enter><wait>\",\n\t\"/install/vmlinuz noapic \",\n\t\"preseed/url=http://{{ .HTTPIP }}:{{ .HTTPPort }}/preseed.cfg \",\n\t\"debian-installer=en_US auto locale=en_US kbd-chooser/method=us \",\n\t\"hostname={{ .Name }} \",\n\t\"fb=false debconf/frontend=noninteractive \",\n\t\"keyboard-configuration/modelcode=SKIP keyboard-configuration/layout=USA \",\n\t\"keyboard-configuration/variant=USA console-setup/ask_detect=false \",\n\t\"initrd=/install/initrd.gz -- <enter>\"\n\n]\n```\n\nFor more examples of various boot commands, see the sample projects from our\n[community templates page](https://packer.io/community-tools#templates).\n\n<!-- End of code generated from the comments of the BootConfig struct in bootcommand/config.go; -->\n\n\n#### Optional:\n\n<!-- Code generated from the comments of the BootConfig struct in bootcommand/config.go; DO NOT EDIT MANUALLY -->\n\n- `boot_keygroup_interval` (duration string | ex: \"1h5m2s\") - Time to wait after sending a group of key pressses. The value of this\n  should be a duration. Examples are `5s` and `1m30s` which will cause\n  Packer to wait five seconds and one minute 30 seconds, respectively. If\n  this isn't specified, a sensible default value is picked depending on\n  the builder type.\n\n- `boot_wait` (duration string | ex: \"1h5m2s\") - The time to wait after booting the initial virtual machine before typing\n  the `boot_command`. The value of this should be a duration. Examples are\n  `5s` and `1m30s` which will cause Packer to wait five seconds and one\n  minute 30 seconds, respectively. If this isn't specified, the default is\n  `10s` or 10 seconds. To set boot_wait to 0s, use a negative number, such\n  as \"-1s\"\n\n- `boot_command` ([]string) - This is an array of commands to type when the virtual machine is first\n  booted. The goal of these commands should be to type just enough to\n  initialize the operating system installer. Special keys can be typed as\n  well, and are covered in the section below on the boot command. If this\n  is not specified, it is assumed the installer will start itself.\n\n<!-- End of code generated from the comments of the BootConfig struct in bootcommand/config.go; -->\n\n\n### Http directory configuration\n\n<!-- Code generated from the comments of the HTTPConfig struct in multistep/commonsteps/http_config.go; DO NOT EDIT MANUALLY -->\n\nPacker will create an http server serving `http_directory` when it is set, a\nrandom free port will be selected and the architecture of the directory\nreferenced will be available in your builder.\n\nExample usage from a builder:\n\n```\nwget http://{{ .HTTPIP }}:{{ .HTTPPort }}/foo/bar/preseed.cfg\n```\n\n<!-- End of code generated from the comments of the HTTPConfig struct in multistep/commonsteps/http_config.go; -->\n\n\n#### Optional:\n\n<!-- Code generated from the comments of the HTTPConfig struct in multistep/commonsteps/http_config.go; DO NOT EDIT MANUALLY -->\n\n- `http_directory` (string) - Path to a directory to serve using an HTTP server. The files in this\n  directory will be available over HTTP that will be requestable from the\n  virtual machine. This is useful for hosting kickstart files and so on.\n  By default this is an empty string, which means no HTTP server will be\n  started. The address and port of the HTTP server will be available as\n  variables in `boot_command`. This is covered in more detail below.\n\n- `http_content` (map[string]string) - Key/Values to serve using an HTTP server. `http_content` works like and\n  conflicts with `http_directory`. The keys represent the paths and the\n  values contents, the keys must start with a slash, ex: `/path/to/file`.\n  `http_content` is useful for hosting kickstart files and so on. By\n  default this is empty, which means no HTTP server will be started. The\n  address and port of the HTTP server will be available as variables in\n  `boot_command`. This is covered in more detail below.\n  Example:\n  ```hcl\n    http_content = {\n      \"/a/b\"     = file(\"http/b\")\n      \"/foo/bar\" = templatefile(\"${path.root}/preseed.cfg\", { packages = [\"nginx\"] })\n    }\n  ```\n\n- `http_port_min` (int) - These are the minimum and maximum port to use for the HTTP server\n  started to serve the `http_directory`. Because Packer often runs in\n  parallel, Packer will choose a randomly available port in this range to\n  run the HTTP server. If you want to force the HTTP server to be on one\n  port, make this minimum and maximum port the same. By default the values\n  are `8000` and `9000`, respectively.\n\n- `http_port_max` (int) - HTTP Port Max\n\n- `http_bind_address` (string) - This is the bind address for the HTTP server. Defaults to 0.0.0.0 so that\n  it will work with any network interface.\n\n<!-- End of code generated from the comments of the HTTPConfig struct in multistep/commonsteps/http_config.go; -->\n\n\n- `http_interface` - (string) - Name of the network interface that Packer gets\n  `HTTPIP` from. Defaults to the first non loopback interface.\n\n## Example: Fedora with kickstart\n\nHere is a basic example creating a Fedora 29 server image with a Kickstart\nfile served with Packer's HTTP server.
