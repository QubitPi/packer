The builder takes either an ISO\nor an existing template as it's source, runs any provisioning necessary on the\ninstance after launching it and then creates a new template from that instance.\n\nThe builder does _not_ manage templates. Once a template is created, it is up\nto you to use it or delete it.\n\n## Configuration Reference\n\nThere are many configuration options available for the builder. They are\nsegmented below into two categories: required and optional parameters. Within\neach category, the available configuration keys are alphabetized.\n\nIn addition to the options listed here, a\n[communicator](/packer/docs/templates/legacy_json_templates/communicator) can be configured for this\nbuilder.\n\n### Required:\n\n- `api_url` (string) - The CloudStack API endpoint we will connect to. It can\n  also be specified via environment variable `CLOUDSTACK_API_URL`, if set.\n\n- `api_key` (string) - The API key used to sign all API requests.

Defaults to `false`.\n\n- `http_get_only` (boolean) - Some cloud providers only allow HTTP GET calls\n  to their CloudStack API. If using such a provider, you need to set this to\n  `true` in order for the provider to only make GET calls and no POST calls.\n\n- `hypervisor` (string) - The target hypervisor (e.g. `XenServer`, `KVM`) for\n  the new template. This option is required when using `source_iso`.\n\n- `eject_iso` (boolean) - If `true` make a call to the CloudStack API, after\n  loading image to cache, requesting to check and detach ISO file (if any)\n  currently attached to a virtual machine. Defaults to `false`. This option\n  is only available when using `source_iso`.\n\n- `eject_iso_delay` (time.Duration) - Configure the duration time to wait, making\n  sure virtual machine is able to finish installing OS before it ejects safely.\n  Requires `eject_iso` set to `true` and this option is only available when\n  using `source_iso`.\n\n- `keypair` (string) - The name of the SSH key pair that will be used to\n  access the instance. The SSH key pair is assumed to be already available\n  within CloudStack.\n\n- `instance_name` (string) - The name of the instance. Defaults to\n  \"packer-UUID\" where UUID is dynamically generated.\n\n- `prevent_firewall_changes` (boolean) - Set to `true` to prevent network\n  ACLs or firewall rules creation. Defaults to `false`.\n\n- `project` (string) - The name or ID of the project to deploy the instance\n  to.\n\n- `public_ip_address` (string) - The public IP address or it's ID used for\n  connecting any provisioners to. If not provided, a temporary public IP\n  address will be associated and released during the Packer run.\n\n- `public_port` (number) - The fixed port you want to configure in the port\n  forwarding rule. Set this attribute if you do not want to use the a random\n  public port.\n\n- `security_groups` (array of strings) - A list of security group IDs or\n  names to associate the instance with.\n\n- `ssl_no_verify` (boolean) - Set to `true` to skip SSL verification.\n  Defaults to `false`.\n\n- `template_display_text` (string) - The display text of the new template.\n  Defaults to the `template_name`.\n\n- `template_featured` (boolean) - Set to `true` to indicate that the template\n  is featured.

By default, Packer generates a name that looks like\n  `packer_<UUID>`, where &lt;UUID&gt; is a 36 character unique identifier.\n\n- `user_data` (string) - User data to launch with the instance. This is a\n  [template engine](/packer/docs/templates/legacy_json_templates/engine) see _User\n  Data_ below for more details. Packer will not automatically wait for a user\n  script to finish before shutting down the instance this must be handled in a\n  provisioner.\n\n- `user_data_file` (string) - Path to a file that will be used for the user\n  data when launching the instance. This file will be parsed as a [template\n  engine](/packer/docs/templates/legacy_json_templates/engine) see _User Data_ below\n  for more details.\n\n- `use_local_ip_address` (boolean) - Set to `true` to indicate that the\n  provisioners should connect to the local IP address of the instance.\n\n## User Data\n\nThe available variables are:\n\n- `HTTPIP` and `HTTPPort` - The IP and port, respectively of an HTTP server\n  that is started serving the directory specified by the `http_directory`\n  configuration parameter. If `http_directory` isn't specified, these will be\n  blank. Example: `{{.HTTPIP}}:{{.HTTPPort}}/path/to/a/file/in/http_directory`\n\n### Communicator Configuration\n\n#### Optional:\n\n<!-- Code generated from the comments of the Config struct in communicator/config.go; DO NOT EDIT MANUALLY -->\n\n- `communicator` (string) - Packer currently supports three kinds of communicators:\n  \n  -   `none` - No communicator will be used. If this is set, most\n      provisioners also can't be used.\n  \n  -   `ssh` - An SSH connection will be established to the machine. This\n      is usually the default.\n  \n  -   `winrm` - A WinRM connection will be established.\n  \n  In addition to the above, some builders have custom communicators they\n  can use. For example, the Docker builder has a \"docker\" communicator\n  that uses `docker exec` and `docker cp` to execute scripts and copy\n  files.\n\n- `pause_before_connecting` (duration string | ex: \"1h5m2s\") - We recommend that you enable SSH or WinRM as the very last step in your\n  guest's bootstrap script, but sometimes you may have a race condition\n  where you need Packer to wait before attempting to connect to your\n  guest.\n  \n  If you end up in this situation, you can use the template option\n  `pause_before_connecting`. By default, there is no pause. For example if\n  you set `pause_before_connecting` to `10m` Packer will check whether it\n  can connect, as normal. But once a connection attempt is successful, it\n  will disconnect and then wait 10 minutes before connecting to the guest\n  and beginning provisioning.\n\n<!-- End of code generated from the comments of the Config struct in communicator/config.go; -->\n\n\n<!-- Code generated from the comments of the SSH struct in communicator/config.go; DO NOT EDIT MANUALLY -->\n\n- `ssh_host` (string) - The address to SSH to. This usually is automatically configured by the\n  builder.\n\n- `ssh_port` (int) - The port to connect to SSH.

Required if using SSH.\n\n- `ssh_password` (string) - A plaintext password to use to authenticate with SSH.\n\n- `ssh_ciphers` ([]string) - This overrides the value of ciphers supported by default by Golang.\n  The default value is [\n    \"aes128-gcm@openssh.com\",\n    \"chacha20-poly1305@openssh.com\",\n    \"aes128-ctr\", \"aes192-ctr\", \"aes256-ctr\",\n  ]\n  \n  Valid options for ciphers include:\n  \"aes128-ctr\", \"aes192-ctr\", \"aes256-ctr\", \"aes128-gcm@openssh.com\",\n  \"chacha20-poly1305@openssh.com\",\n  \"arcfour256\", \"arcfour128\", \"arcfour\", \"aes128-cbc\", \"3des-cbc\",\n\n- `ssh_clear_authorized_keys` (bool) - If true, Packer will attempt to remove its temporary key from\n  `~/.ssh/authorized_keys` and `/root/.ssh/authorized_keys`. This is a\n  mostly cosmetic option, since Packer will delete the temporary private\n  key from the host system regardless of whether this is set to true\n  (unless the user has set the `-debug` flag). Defaults to \"false\";\n  currently only works on guests with `sed` installed.\n\n- `ssh_key_exchange_algorithms` ([]string) - If set, Packer will override the value of key exchange (kex) algorithms\n  supported by default by Golang. Acceptable values include:\n  \"curve25519-sha256@libssh.org\", \"ecdh-sha2-nistp256\",\n  \"ecdh-sha2-nistp384\", \"ecdh-sha2-nistp521\",\n  \"diffie-hellman-group14-sha1\", and \"diffie-hellman-group1-sha1\".\n\n- `ssh_certificate_file` (string) - Path to user certificate used to authenticate with SSH.\n  The `~` can be used in path and will be expanded to the\n  home directory of current user.\n\n- `ssh_pty` (bool) - If `true`, a PTY will be requested for the SSH connection. This defaults\n  to `false`.\n\n- `ssh_timeout` (duration string | ex: \"1h5m2s\") - The time to wait for SSH to become available. Packer uses this to\n  determine when the machine has booted so this is usually quite long.\n  Example value: `10m`.\n  This defaults to `5m`, unless `ssh_handshake_attempts` is set.\n\n- `ssh_disable_agent_forwarding` (bool) - If true, SSH agent forwarding will be disabled. Defaults to `false`.\n\n- `ssh_handshake_attempts` (int) - The number of handshakes to attempt with SSH once it can connect.\n  This defaults to `10`, unless a `ssh_timeout` is set.\n\n- `ssh_bastion_host` (string) - A bastion host to use for the actual SSH connection.\n\n- `ssh_bastion_port` (int) - The port of the bastion host. Defaults to `22`.\n\n- `ssh_bastion_agent_auth` (bool) - If `true`, the local SSH agent will be used to authenticate with the\n  bastion host.

The `~` can be used in path and will be expanded to the\n  home directory of current user.\n\n- `ssh_bastion_certificate_file` (string) - Path to user certificate used to authenticate with bastion host.\n  The `~` can be used in path and will be expanded to the\n  home directory of current user.\n\n- `ssh_file_transfer_method` (string) - `scp` or `sftp` - How to transfer files, Secure copy (default) or SSH\n  File Transfer Protocol.\n  \n  **NOTE**: Guests using Windows with Win32-OpenSSH v9.1.0.0p1-Beta, scp\n  (the default protocol for copying data) returns a a non-zero error code since the MOTW\n  cannot be set, which cause any file transfer to fail. As a workaround you can override the transfer protocol\n  with SFTP instead `ssh_file_transfer_protocol = \"sftp\"`.\n\n- `ssh_proxy_host` (string) - A SOCKS proxy host to use for SSH connection\n\n- `ssh_proxy_port` (int) - A port of the SOCKS proxy. Defaults to `1080`.\n\n- `ssh_proxy_username` (string) - The optional username to authenticate with the proxy server.\n\n- `ssh_proxy_password` (string) - The optional password to use to authenticate with the proxy server.\n\n- `ssh_keep_alive_interval` (duration string | ex: \"1h5m2s\") - How often to send \"keep alive\" messages to the server.

Defaults to `5s`.\n\n- `ssh_read_write_timeout` (duration string | ex: \"1h5m2s\") - The amount of time to wait for a remote command to end. This might be\n  useful if, for example, packer hangs on a connection after a reboot.\n  Example: `5m`. Disabled by default.\n\n- `ssh_remote_tunnels` ([]string) - \n\n- `ssh_local_tunnels` ([]string) - \n\n<!-- End of code generated from the comments of the SSH struct in communicator/config.go; -->\n\n\n<!-- Code generated from the comments of the SSHTemporaryKeyPair struct in communicator/config.go; DO NOT EDIT MANUALLY -->\n\n- `temporary_key_pair_type` (string) - `dsa` | `ecdsa` | `ed25519` | `rsa` ( the default )\n  \n  Specifies the type of key to create. The possible values are 'dsa',\n  'ecdsa', 'ed25519', or 'rsa'.\n  \n  NOTE: DSA is deprecated and no longer recognized as secure, please\n  consider other alternatives like RSA or ED25519.\n\n- `temporary_key_pair_bits` (int) - Specifies the number of bits in the key to create. For RSA keys, the\n  minimum size is 1024 bits and the default is 4096 bits. Generally, 3072\n  bits is considered sufficient. DSA keys must be exactly 1024 bits as\n  specified by FIPS 186-2. For ECDSA keys, bits determines the key length\n  by selecting from one of three elliptic curve sizes: 256, 384 or 521\n  bits. Attempting to use bit lengths other than these three values for\n  ECDSA keys will fail. Ed25519 keys have a fixed length and bits will be\n  ignored.\n  \n  NOTE: DSA is deprecated and no longer recognized as secure as specified\n  by FIPS 186-5, please consider other alternatives like RSA or ED25519.\n\n<!-- End of code generated from the comments of the SSHTemporaryKeyPair struct in communicator/config.go; -->\n\n\n- `ssh_keypair_name` (string) - If specified, this is the key that will be used for SSH with the\n  machine. The key must match a key pair name loaded up into the remote.\n  By default, this is blank, and Packer will generate a temporary keypair\n  unless [`ssh_password`](#ssh_password) is used.\n  [`ssh_private_key_file`](#ssh_private_key_file) or\n  [`ssh_agent_auth`](#ssh_agent_auth) must be specified when\n  [`ssh_keypair_name`](#ssh_keypair_name) is utilized.\n\n\n- `ssh_private_key_file` (string) - Path to a PEM encoded private key file to use to authenticate with SSH.\n  The `~` can be used in path and will be expanded to the home directory\n  of current user.\n\n\n- `ssh_agent_auth` (bool) - If true, the local SSH agent will be used to authenticate connections to\n  the source instance. No temporary keypair will be created, and the\n  values of [`ssh_password`](#ssh_password) and\n  [`ssh_private_key_file`](#ssh_private_key_file) will be ignored. The\n  environment variable `SSH_AUTH_SOCK` must be set for this option to work\n  properly.\n\n\n## Http directory configuration\n\n<!-- Code generated from the comments of the HTTPConfig struct in multistep/commonsteps/http_config.go; DO NOT EDIT MANUALLY -->\n\nPacker will create an http server serving `http_directory` when it is set, a\nrandom free port will be selected and the architecture of the directory\nreferenced will be available in your builder.\n\nExample usage from a builder:\n\n```\nwget http://{{ .HTTPIP }}:{{ .HTTPPort }}/foo/bar/preseed.cfg\n```\n\n<!-- End of code generated from the comments of the HTTPConfig struct in multistep/commonsteps/http_config.go; -->\n\n\n### Optional:\n\n<!-- Code generated from the comments of the HTTPConfig struct in multistep/commonsteps/http_config.go; DO NOT EDIT MANUALLY -->\n\n- `http_directory` (string) - Path to a directory to serve using an HTTP server. The files in this\n  directory will be available over HTTP that will be requestable from the\n  virtual machine. This is useful for hosting kickstart files and so on.\n  By default this is an empty string, which means no HTTP server will be\n  started. The address and port of the HTTP server will be available as\n  variables in `boot_command`. This is covered in more detail below.\n\n- `http_content` (map[string]string) - Key/Values to serve using an HTTP server. `http_content` works like and\n  conflicts with `http_directory`. The keys represent the paths and the\n  values contents, the keys must start with a slash, ex: `/path/to/file`.\n  `http_content` is useful for hosting kickstart files and so on. By\n  default this is empty, which means no HTTP server will be started. The\n  address and port of the HTTP server will be available as variables in\n  `boot_command`. This is covered in more detail below.\n  Example:\n  ```hcl\n    http_content = {\n      \"/a/b\"     = file(\"http/b\")\n      \"/foo/bar\" = templatefile(\"${path.root}/preseed.cfg\", { packages = [\"nginx\"] })\n    }\n  ```\n\n- `http_port_min` (int) - These are the minimum and maximum port to use for the HTTP server\n  started to serve the `http_directory`. Because Packer often runs in\n  parallel, Packer will choose a randomly available port in this range to\n  run the HTTP server.

The builder takes either an ISO\nor an existing template as it's source, runs any provisioning necessary on the\ninstance after launching it and then creates a new template from that instance.\n\nThe builder does _not_ manage templates. Once a template is created, it is up\nto you to use it or delete it.\n\n## Configuration Reference\n\nThere are many configuration options available for the builder. They are\nsegmented below into two categories: required and optional parameters. Within\neach category, the available configuration keys are alphabetized.\n\nIn addition to the options listed here, a\n[communicator](/packer/docs/templates/legacy_json_templates/communicator) can be configured for this\nbuilder.\n\n### Required:\n\n- `api_url` (string) - The CloudStack API endpoint we will connect to. It can\n  also be specified via environment variable `CLOUDSTACK_API_URL`, if set.\n\n- `api_key` (string) - The API key used to sign all API requests. It can also\n  be specified via environment variable `CLOUDSTACK_API_KEY`, if set.\n\n- `network` (string) - The name or ID of the network to connect the instance\n  to.\n\n- `secret_key` (string) - The secret key used to sign all API requests. It\n  can also be specified via environment variable `CLOUDSTACK_SECRET_KEY`, if\n  set.\n\n- `service_offering` (string) - The name or ID of the service offering used\n  for the instance.\n\n- `source_iso` (string) - The name or ID of an ISO that will be mounted\n  before booting the instance. This option is mutually exclusive with\n  `source_template`. When using `source_iso`, both `disk_offering` and\n  `hypervisor` are required.\n\n- `source_template` (string) - The name or ID of the template used as base\n  template for the instance. This option is mutually exclusive with\n  `source_iso`.\n\n- `template_os` (string) - The name or ID of the template OS for the new\n  template that will be created.\n\n- `zone` (string) - The name or ID of the zone where the instance will be\n  created.\n\n### Optional:\n\n- `async_timeout` (number) - The time duration to wait for async calls to\n  finish.

Defaults to `[ \"0.0.0.0/0\" ]`. Only required when\n  `use_local_ip_address` is `false`.\n\n- `create_security_group` (boolean) - If `true` a temporary security group\n  will be created which allows traffic towards the instance from the\n  `cidr_list`. This option will be ignored if `security_groups` is also\n  defined. Requires `expunge` set to `true`. Defaults to `false`.\n\n- `disk_offering` (string) - The name or ID of the disk offering used for the\n  instance. This option is only available (and also required) when using\n  `source_iso`.\n\n- `disk_size` (number) - The size (in GB) of the root disk of the new instance.\n\n- `expunge` (boolean) - Set to `true` to expunge the instance when it is\n  destroyed. Defaults to `false`.\n\n- `http_get_only` (boolean) - Some cloud providers only allow HTTP GET calls\n  to their CloudStack API. If using such a provider, you need to set this to\n  `true` in order for the provider to only make GET calls and no POST calls.\n\n- `hypervisor` (string) - The target hypervisor (e.g. `XenServer`, `KVM`) for\n  the new template. This option is required when using `source_iso`.\n\n- `eject_iso` (boolean) - If `true` make a call to the CloudStack API, after\n  loading image to cache, requesting to check and detach ISO file (if any)\n  currently attached to a virtual machine. Defaults to `false`. This option\n  is only available when using `source_iso`.\n\n- `eject_iso_delay` (time.Duration) - Configure the duration time to wait, making\n  sure virtual machine is able to finish installing OS before it ejects safely.\n  Requires `eject_iso` set to `true` and this option is only available when\n  using `source_iso`.\n\n- `keypair` (string) - The name of the SSH key pair that will be used to\n  access the instance. The SSH key pair is assumed to be already available\n  within CloudStack.\n\n- `instance_name` (string) - The name of the instance. Defaults to\n  \"packer-UUID\" where UUID is dynamically generated.\n\n- `prevent_firewall_changes` (boolean) - Set to `true` to prevent network\n  ACLs or firewall rules creation. Defaults to `false`.\n\n- `project` (string) - The name or ID of the project to deploy the instance\n  to.\n\n- `public_ip_address` (string) - The public IP address or it's ID used for\n  connecting any provisioners to. If not provided, a temporary public IP\n  address will be associated and released during the Packer run.\n\n- `public_port` (number) - The fixed port you want to configure in the port\n  forwarding rule. Set this attribute if you do not want to use the a random\n  public port.\n\n- `security_groups` (array of strings) - A list of security group IDs or\n  names to associate the instance with.\n\n- `ssl_no_verify` (boolean) - Set to `true` to skip SSL verification.\n  Defaults to `false`.\n\n- `template_display_text` (string) - The display text of the new template.\n  Defaults to the `template_name`.\n\n- `template_featured` (boolean) - Set to `true` to indicate that the template\n  is featured. Defaults to `false`.\n\n- `template_name` (string) - The name of the new template. Defaults to\n  `packer-{{timestamp}}` where timestamp will be the current time.\n\n- `template_public` (boolean) - Set to `true` to indicate that the template\n  is available for all accounts. Defaults to `false`.\n\n- `template_password_enabled` (boolean) - Set to `true` to indicate the\n  template should be password enabled. Defaults to `false`.\n\n- `template_requires_hvm` (boolean) - Set to `true` to indicate the template\n  requires hardware-assisted virtualization. Defaults to `false`.\n\n- `template_scalable` (boolean) - Set to `true` to indicate that the template\n  contains tools to support dynamic scaling of VM cpu/memory. Defaults to\n  `false`.\n\n- `temporary_keypair_name` (string) - The name of the temporary SSH key pair\n  to generate. By default, Packer generates a name that looks like\n  `packer_<UUID>`, where &lt;UUID&gt; is a 36 character unique identifier.\n\n- `user_data` (string) - User data to launch with the instance. This is a\n  [template engine](/packer/docs/templates/legacy_json_templates/engine) see _User\n  Data_ below for more details. Packer will not automatically wait for a user\n  script to finish before shutting down the instance this must be handled in a\n  provisioner.\n\n- `user_data_file` (string) - Path to a file that will be used for the user\n  data when launching the instance. This file will be parsed as a [template\n  engine](/packer/docs/templates/legacy_json_templates/engine) see _User Data_ below\n  for more details.\n\n- `use_local_ip_address` (boolean) - Set to `true` to indicate that the\n  provisioners should connect to the local IP address of the instance.\n\n## User Data\n\nThe available variables are:\n\n- `HTTPIP` and `HTTPPort` - The IP and port, respectively of an HTTP server\n  that is started serving the directory specified by the `http_directory`\n  configuration parameter. If `http_directory` isn't specified, these will be\n  blank. Example: `{{.HTTPIP}}:{{.HTTPPort}}/path/to/a/file/in/http_directory`\n\n### Communicator Configuration\n\n#### Optional:\n\n<!-- Code generated from the comments of the Config struct in communicator/config.go; DO NOT EDIT MANUALLY -->\n\n- `communicator` (string) - Packer currently supports three kinds of communicators:\n  \n  -   `none` - No communicator will be used. If this is set, most\n      provisioners also can't be used.\n  \n  -   `ssh` - An SSH connection will be established to the machine. This\n      is usually the default.\n  \n  -   `winrm` - A WinRM connection will be established.\n  \n  In addition to the above, some builders have custom communicators they\n  can use. For example, the Docker builder has a \"docker\" communicator\n  that uses `docker exec` and `docker cp` to execute scripts and copy\n  files.\n\n- `pause_before_connecting` (duration string | ex: \"1h5m2s\") - We recommend that you enable SSH or WinRM as the very last step in your\n  guest's bootstrap script, but sometimes you may have a race condition\n  where you need Packer to wait before attempting to connect to your\n  guest.\n  \n  If you end up in this situation, you can use the template option\n  `pause_before_connecting`. By default, there is no pause. For example if\n  you set `pause_before_connecting` to `10m` Packer will check whether it\n  can connect, as normal. But once a connection attempt is successful, it\n  will disconnect and then wait 10 minutes before connecting to the guest\n  and beginning provisioning.\n\n<!-- End of code generated from the comments of the Config struct in communicator/config.go; -->\n\n\n<!-- Code generated from the comments of the SSH struct in communicator/config.go; DO NOT EDIT MANUALLY -->\n\n- `ssh_host` (string) - The address to SSH to. This usually is automatically configured by the\n  builder.\n\n- `ssh_port` (int) - The port to connect to SSH. This defaults to `22`.\n\n- `ssh_username` (string) - The username to connect to SSH with. Required if using SSH.\n\n- `ssh_password` (string) - A plaintext password to use to authenticate with SSH.\n\n- `ssh_ciphers` ([]string) - This overrides the value of ciphers supported by default by Golang.\n  The default value is [\n    \"aes128-gcm@openssh.com\",\n    \"chacha20-poly1305@openssh.com\",\n    \"aes128-ctr\", \"aes192-ctr\", \"aes256-ctr\",\n  ]\n  \n  Valid options for ciphers include:\n  \"aes128-ctr\", \"aes192-ctr\", \"aes256-ctr\", \"aes128-gcm@openssh.com\",\n  \"chacha20-poly1305@openssh.com\",\n  \"arcfour256\", \"arcfour128\", \"arcfour\", \"aes128-cbc\", \"3des-cbc\",\n\n- `ssh_clear_authorized_keys` (bool) - If true, Packer will attempt to remove its temporary key from\n  `~/.ssh/authorized_keys` and `/root/.ssh/authorized_keys`. This is a\n  mostly cosmetic option, since Packer will delete the temporary private\n  key from the host system regardless of whether this is set to true\n  (unless the user has set the `-debug` flag). Defaults to \"false\";\n  currently only works on guests with `sed` installed.\n\n- `ssh_key_exchange_algorithms` ([]string) - If set, Packer will override the value of key exchange (kex) algorithms\n  supported by default by Golang. Acceptable values include:\n  \"curve25519-sha256@libssh.org\", \"ecdh-sha2-nistp256\",\n  \"ecdh-sha2-nistp384\", \"ecdh-sha2-nistp521\",\n  \"diffie-hellman-group14-sha1\", and \"diffie-hellman-group1-sha1\".\n\n- `ssh_certificate_file` (string) - Path to user certificate used to authenticate with SSH.\n  The `~` can be used in path and will be expanded to the\n  home directory of current user.\n\n- `ssh_pty` (bool) - If `true`, a PTY will be requested for the SSH connection. This defaults\n  to `false`.\n\n- `ssh_timeout` (duration string | ex: \"1h5m2s\") - The time to wait for SSH to become available. Packer uses this to\n  determine when the machine has booted so this is usually quite long.\n  Example value: `10m`.\n  This defaults to `5m`, unless `ssh_handshake_attempts` is set.\n\n- `ssh_disable_agent_forwarding` (bool) - If true, SSH agent forwarding will be disabled. Defaults to `false`.\n\n- `ssh_handshake_attempts` (int) - The number of handshakes to attempt with SSH once it can connect.\n  This defaults to `10`, unless a `ssh_timeout` is set.\n\n- `ssh_bastion_host` (string) - A bastion host to use for the actual SSH connection.\n\n- `ssh_bastion_port` (int) - The port of the bastion host. Defaults to `22`.\n\n- `ssh_bastion_agent_auth` (bool) - If `true`, the local SSH agent will be used to authenticate with the\n  bastion host.

The `~` can be used in path and will be expanded to the\n  home directory of current user.\n\n- `ssh_bastion_certificate_file` (string) - Path to user certificate used to authenticate with bastion host.\n  The `~` can be used in path and will be expanded to the\n  home directory of current user.\n\n- `ssh_file_transfer_method` (string) - `scp` or `sftp` - How to transfer files, Secure copy (default) or SSH\n  File Transfer Protocol.\n  \n  **NOTE**: Guests using Windows with Win32-OpenSSH v9.1.0.0p1-Beta, scp\n  (the default protocol for copying data) returns a a non-zero error code since the MOTW\n  cannot be set, which cause any file transfer to fail. As a workaround you can override the transfer protocol\n  with SFTP instead `ssh_file_transfer_protocol = \"sftp\"`.\n\n- `ssh_proxy_host` (string) - A SOCKS proxy host to use for SSH connection\n\n- `ssh_proxy_port` (int) - A port of the SOCKS proxy. Defaults to `1080`.\n\n- `ssh_proxy_username` (string) - The optional username to authenticate with the proxy server.\n\n- `ssh_proxy_password` (string) - The optional password to use to authenticate with the proxy server.\n\n- `ssh_keep_alive_interval` (duration string | ex: \"1h5m2s\") - How often to send \"keep alive\" messages to the server. Set to a negative\n  value (`-1s`) to disable. Example value: `10s`. Defaults to `5s`.\n\n- `ssh_read_write_timeout` (duration string | ex: \"1h5m2s\") - The amount of time to wait for a remote command to end. This might be\n  useful if, for example, packer hangs on a connection after a reboot.\n  Example: `5m`. Disabled by default.\n\n- `ssh_remote_tunnels` ([]string) - \n\n- `ssh_local_tunnels` ([]string) - \n\n<!-- End of code generated from the comments of the SSH struct in communicator/config.go; -->\n\n\n<!-- Code generated from the comments of the SSHTemporaryKeyPair struct in communicator/config.go; DO NOT EDIT MANUALLY -->\n\n- `temporary_key_pair_type` (string) - `dsa` | `ecdsa` | `ed25519` | `rsa` ( the default )\n  \n  Specifies the type of key to create. The possible values are 'dsa',\n  'ecdsa', 'ed25519', or 'rsa'.\n  \n  NOTE: DSA is deprecated and no longer recognized as secure, please\n  consider other alternatives like RSA or ED25519.\n\n- `temporary_key_pair_bits` (int) - Specifies the number of bits in the key to create. For RSA keys, the\n  minimum size is 1024 bits and the default is 4096 bits. Generally, 3072\n  bits is considered sufficient. DSA keys must be exactly 1024 bits as\n  specified by FIPS 186-2. For ECDSA keys, bits determines the key length\n  by selecting from one of three elliptic curve sizes: 256, 384 or 521\n  bits. Attempting to use bit lengths other than these three values for\n  ECDSA keys will fail. Ed25519 keys have a fixed length and bits will be\n  ignored.\n  \n  NOTE: DSA is deprecated and no longer recognized as secure as specified\n  by FIPS 186-5, please consider other alternatives like RSA or ED25519.\n\n<!-- End of code generated from the comments of the SSHTemporaryKeyPair struct in communicator/config.go; -->\n\n\n- `ssh_keypair_name` (string) - If specified, this is the key that will be used for SSH with the\n  machine. The key must match a key pair name loaded up into the remote.\n  By default, this is blank, and Packer will generate a temporary keypair\n  unless [`ssh_password`](#ssh_password) is used.\n  [`ssh_private_key_file`](#ssh_private_key_file) or\n  [`ssh_agent_auth`](#ssh_agent_auth) must be specified when\n  [`ssh_keypair_name`](#ssh_keypair_name) is utilized.\n\n\n- `ssh_private_key_file` (string) - Path to a PEM encoded private key file to use to authenticate with SSH.\n  The `~` can be used in path and will be expanded to the home directory\n  of current user.\n\n\n- `ssh_agent_auth` (bool) - If true, the local SSH agent will be used to authenticate connections to\n  the source instance. No temporary keypair will be created, and the\n  values of [`ssh_password`](#ssh_password) and\n  [`ssh_private_key_file`](#ssh_private_key_file) will be ignored. The\n  environment variable `SSH_AUTH_SOCK` must be set for this option to work\n  properly.\n\n\n## Http directory configuration\n\n<!-- Code generated from the comments of the HTTPConfig struct in multistep/commonsteps/http_config.go; DO NOT EDIT MANUALLY -->\n\nPacker will create an http server serving `http_directory` when it is set, a\nrandom free port will be selected and the architecture of the directory\nreferenced will be available in your builder.\n\nExample usage from a builder:\n\n```\nwget http://{{ .HTTPIP }}:{{ .HTTPPort }}/foo/bar/preseed.cfg\n```\n\n<!-- End of code generated from the comments of the HTTPConfig struct in multistep/commonsteps/http_config.go; -->\n\n\n### Optional:\n\n<!-- Code generated from the comments of the HTTPConfig struct in multistep/commonsteps/http_config.go; DO NOT EDIT MANUALLY -->\n\n- `http_directory` (string) - Path to a directory to serve using an HTTP server. The files in this\n  directory will be available over HTTP that will be requestable from the\n  virtual machine. This is useful for hosting kickstart files and so on.\n  By default this is an empty string, which means no HTTP server will be\n  started. The address and port of the HTTP server will be available as\n  variables in `boot_command`. This is covered in more detail below.\n\n- `http_content` (map[string]string) - Key/Values to serve using an HTTP server. `http_content` works like and\n  conflicts with `http_directory`. The keys represent the paths and the\n  values contents, the keys must start with a slash, ex: `/path/to/file`.\n  `http_content` is useful for hosting kickstart files and so on. By\n  default this is empty, which means no HTTP server will be started. The\n  address and port of the HTTP server will be available as variables in\n  `boot_command`. This is covered in more detail below.\n  Example:\n  ```hcl\n    http_content = {\n      \"/a/b\"     = file(\"http/b\")\n      \"/foo/bar\" = templatefile(\"${path.root}/preseed.cfg\", { packages = [\"nginx\"] })\n    }\n  ```\n\n- `http_port_min` (int) - These are the minimum and maximum port to use for the HTTP server\n  started to serve the `http_directory`. Because Packer often runs in\n  parallel, Packer will choose a randomly available port in this range to\n  run the HTTP server.
