The plugin retrieves CVE data from Mondoo, which is updated daily with the latest CVEs and advisories. Additionally, cnspec runs security scans using [cnspec-policies](https://github.com/mondoohq/cnspec-policies) to uncover common misconfigurations that open your hosts to the risk of attack. cnspec supports scanning of Linux, Windows, and macOS, as well as Docker containers.\n\nPacker plugin cnspec is designed to work in one of two modes:\n\n- **Unregistered** - In unregistered mode, the plugin works without being registered to Mondoo Platform, and is designed to provide baseline security scanning with minimal configuration. The plugin runs either the [Linux Security by Mondoo](https://github.com/mondoohq/cnspec-policies/blob/main/core/mondoo-linux-security.mql.yaml) policy on Linux builds, or the [Windows Security by Mondoo](https://github.com/mondoohq/cnspec-policies/blob/main/core/mondoo-windows-security.mql.yaml) policy on Windows builds. Each of these policies provides security hardening checks based off of industry standards for Linux and Windows. Scan results are shown in STDOUT during the Packer run.\n- **Registered** - In registered mode, the plugin is registered to your account in Mondoo Platform using a service account. Registered mode allows you to configure and customize any of the policies in Mondoo Platform including CIS benchmarks and more. Scan results are shown in STDOUT and sent back to Mondoo Platform for your records.\n\n### Installation\n\nTo install this plugin, copy and paste this code into your Packer configuration, then run [`packer init`](https://www.packer.io/docs/commands/init).\n\n```hcl\npacker {\n  required_plugins {\n    cnspec = {\n      version = \">= 10.0.0\"\n      source  = \"github.com/mondoohq/cnspec\"\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\nAlternatively, you can use `packer plugins install` to manage installation of this plugin.\n\n```sh\n$ packer plugins install github.com/mondoohq/cnspec\n```\n\n### Components\n\n#### Provisioners\n\n- [cnspec](/packer/integrations/mondoohq/cnspec/latest/components/provisioner/cnspec) - Packer plugin [cnspec](https://github.com/mondoohq/cnspec) by [Mondoo](https://mondoo.com) scans \nLinux and Windows machine images for vulnerabilities and security misconfigurations.

Defaults to the hostname\n  of the instance.\n\n- `on_failure` (string) - Configure behavior whether packer should fail if `scan_threshold` is\n  not met.

When set to false, scan results will not be sent to\n  Mondoo Platform.\n\n- `policies` ([]string) - A list of policies to be executed (will automatically activate incognito mode).\n\n- `policybundle` (string) - A path to local policy bundle file.\n\n- `sudo` (\\*SudoConfig) - Runs scan with `--sudo`. Defaults to none.\n\n- `winrm_user` (string) - Configure WinRM user. Defaults to `user` set by the packer communicator.\n\n- `winrm_password` (string) - Configure WinRM user password. Defaults to `password` set by the packer\n  communicator.\n\n- `use_proxy` (bool) - Use proxy to connect to host to scan. This configuration will fall-back to\n  packer proxy for cases where the provisioner cannot access the target directly\n\n- `output` (string) - Set output format: compact, csv, full, json, junit, report, summary, yaml\n  (default \"compact\")\n\n- `output_target` (string) - Set output target. E.g. path to local file\n\n- `score_threshold` (int) - An integer value to set the `score_threshold` of mondoo scans. Defaults to\n  `0` which results in a passing score regardless of what scan results are\n  returned.\n\n- `mondoo_config_path` (string) - The path to the Mondoo's service account.
