If this is set, most\n      provisioners also can't be used.\n  \n  -   `ssh` - An SSH connection will be established to the machine. This\n      is usually the default.\n  \n  -   `winrm` - A WinRM connection will be established.\n  \n  In addition to the above, some builders have custom communicators they\n  can use. For example, the Docker builder has a \"docker\" communicator\n  that uses `docker exec` and `docker cp` to execute scripts and copy\n  files.\n\n- `pause_before_connecting` (duration string | ex: \"1h5m2s\") - We recommend that you enable SSH or WinRM as the very last step in your\n  guest's bootstrap script, but sometimes you may have a race condition\n  where you need Packer to wait before attempting to connect to your\n  guest.\n  \n  If you end up in this situation, you can use the template option\n  `pause_before_connecting`. By default, there is no pause. For example if\n  you set `pause_before_connecting` to `10m` Packer will check whether it\n  can connect, as normal. But once a connection attempt is successful, it\n  will disconnect and then wait 10 minutes before connecting to the guest\n  and beginning provisioning.\n\n<!-- End of code generated from the comments of the Config struct in communicator/config.go; -->\n\n\n<!-- Code generated from the comments of the SSH struct in communicator/config.go; DO NOT EDIT MANUALLY -->\n\n- `ssh_host` (string) - The address to SSH to. This usually is automatically configured by the\n  builder.\n\n- `ssh_port` (int) - The port to connect to SSH. This defaults to `22`.\n\n- `ssh_username` (string) - The username to connect to SSH with. Required if using SSH.\n\n- `ssh_password` (string) - A plaintext password to use to authenticate with SSH.\n\n- `ssh_ciphers` ([]string) - This overrides the value of ciphers supported by default by Golang.\n  The default value is [\n    \"aes128-gcm@openssh.com\",\n    \"chacha20-poly1305@openssh.com\",\n    \"aes128-ctr\", \"aes192-ctr\", \"aes256-ctr\",\n  ]\n  \n  Valid options for ciphers include:\n  \"aes128-ctr\", \"aes192-ctr\", \"aes256-ctr\", \"aes128-gcm@openssh.com\",\n  \"chacha20-poly1305@openssh.com\",\n  \"arcfour256\", \"arcfour128\", \"arcfour\", \"aes128-cbc\", \"3des-cbc\",\n\n- `ssh_clear_authorized_keys` (bool) - If true, Packer will attempt to remove its temporary key from\n  `~/.ssh/authorized_keys` and `/root/.ssh/authorized_keys`. This is a\n  mostly cosmetic option, since Packer will delete the temporary private\n  key from the host system regardless of whether this is set to true\n  (unless the user has set the `-debug` flag). Defaults to \"false\";\n  currently only works on guests with `sed` installed.\n\n- `ssh_key_exchange_algorithms` ([]string) - If set, Packer will override the value of key exchange (kex) algorithms\n  supported by default by Golang. Acceptable values include:\n  \"curve25519-sha256@libssh.org\", \"ecdh-sha2-nistp256\",\n  \"ecdh-sha2-nistp384\", \"ecdh-sha2-nistp521\",\n  \"diffie-hellman-group14-sha1\", and \"diffie-hellman-group1-sha1\".\n\n- `ssh_certificate_file` (string) - Path to user certificate used to authenticate with SSH.\n  The `~` can be used in path and will be expanded to the\n  home directory of current user.\n\n- `ssh_pty` (bool) - If `true`, a PTY will be requested for the SSH connection. This defaults\n  to `false`.\n\n- `ssh_timeout` (duration string | ex: \"1h5m2s\") - The time to wait for SSH to become available. Packer uses this to\n  determine when the machine has booted so this is usually quite long.\n  Example value: `10m`.\n  This defaults to `5m`, unless `ssh_handshake_attempts` is set.\n\n- `ssh_disable_agent_forwarding` (bool) - If true, SSH agent forwarding will be disabled. Defaults to `false`.\n\n- `ssh_handshake_attempts` (int) - The number of handshakes to attempt with SSH once it can connect.\n  This defaults to `10`, unless a `ssh_timeout` is set.\n\n- `ssh_bastion_host` (string) - A bastion host to use for the actual SSH connection.\n\n- `ssh_bastion_port` (int) - The port of the bastion host. Defaults to `22`.\n\n- `ssh_bastion_agent_auth` (bool) - If `true`, the local SSH agent will be used to authenticate with the\n  bastion host. Defaults to `false`.\n\n- `ssh_bastion_username` (string) - The username to connect to the bastion host.\n\n- `ssh_bastion_password` (string) - The password to use to authenticate with the bastion host.\n\n- `ssh_bastion_interactive` (bool) - If `true`, the keyboard-interactive used to authenticate with bastion host.\n\n- `ssh_bastion_private_key_file` (string) - Path to a PEM encoded private key file to use to authenticate with the\n  bastion host. The `~` can be used in path and will be expanded to the\n  home directory of current user.\n\n- `ssh_bastion_certificate_file` (string) - Path to user certificate used to authenticate with bastion host.\n  The `~` can be used in path and will be expanded to the\n  home directory of current user.\n\n- `ssh_file_transfer_method` (string) - `scp` or `sftp` - How to transfer files, Secure copy (default) or SSH\n  File Transfer Protocol.\n  \n  **NOTE**: Guests using Windows with Win32-OpenSSH v9.1.0.0p1-Beta, scp\n  (the default protocol for copying data) returns a a non-zero error code since the MOTW\n  cannot be set, which cause any file transfer to fail. As a workaround you can override the transfer protocol\n  with SFTP instead `ssh_file_transfer_protocol = \"sftp\"`.\n\n- `ssh_proxy_host` (string) - A SOCKS proxy host to use for SSH connection\n\n- `ssh_proxy_port` (int) - A port of the SOCKS proxy. Defaults to `1080`.\n\n- `ssh_proxy_username` (string) - The optional username to authenticate with the proxy server.\n\n- `ssh_proxy_password` (string) - The optional password to use to authenticate with the proxy server.\n\n- `ssh_keep_alive_interval` (duration string | ex: \"1h5m2s\") - How often to send \"keep alive\" messages to the server. Set to a negative\n  value (`-1s`) to disable. Example value: `10s`. Defaults to `5s`.\n\n- `ssh_read_write_timeout` (duration string | ex: \"1h5m2s\") - The amount of time to wait for a remote command to end. This might be\n  useful if, for example, packer hangs on a connection after a reboot.\n  Example: `5m`. Disabled by default.\n\n- `ssh_remote_tunnels` ([]string) - \n\n- `ssh_local_tunnels` ([]string) - \n\n<!-- End of code generated from the comments of the SSH struct in communicator/config.go; -->\n\n\n<!-- Code generated from the comments of the SSHTemporaryKeyPair struct in communicator/config.go; DO NOT EDIT MANUALLY -->\n\n- `temporary_key_pair_type` (string) - `dsa` | `ecdsa` | `ed25519` | `rsa` ( the default )\n  \n  Specifies the type of key to create. The possible values are 'dsa',\n  'ecdsa', 'ed25519', or 'rsa'.\n  \n  NOTE: DSA is deprecated and no longer recognized as secure, please\n  consider other alternatives like RSA or ED25519.\n\n- `temporary_key_pair_bits` (int) - Specifies the number of bits in the key to create. For RSA keys, the\n  minimum size is 1024 bits and the default is 4096 bits. Generally, 3072\n  bits is considered sufficient. DSA keys must be exactly 1024 bits as\n  specified by FIPS 186-2. For ECDSA keys, bits determines the key length\n  by selecting from one of three elliptic curve sizes: 256, 384 or 521\n  bits. Attempting to use bit lengths other than these three values for\n  ECDSA keys will fail. Ed25519 keys have a fixed length and bits will be\n  ignored.\n  \n  NOTE: DSA is deprecated and no longer recognized as secure as specified\n  by FIPS 186-5, please consider other alternatives like RSA or ED25519.\n\n<!-- End of code generated from the comments of the SSHTemporaryKeyPair struct in communicator/config.go; -->\n\n\n- `ssh_keypair_name` (string) - If specified, this is the key that will be used for SSH with the\n  machine. The key must match a key pair name loaded up into the remote.\n  By default, this is blank, and Packer will generate a temporary keypair\n  unless [`ssh_password`](#ssh_password) is used.\n  [`ssh_private_key_file`](#ssh_private_key_file) or\n  [`ssh_agent_auth`](#ssh_agent_auth) must be specified when\n  [`ssh_keypair_name`](#ssh_keypair_name) is utilized.\n\n\n- `ssh_private_key_file` (string) - Path to a PEM encoded private key file to use to authenticate with SSH.\n  The `~` can be used in path and will be expanded to the home directory\n  of current user.\n\n\n- `ssh_agent_auth` (bool) - If true, the local SSH agent will be used to authenticate connections to\n  the source instance. No temporary keypair will be created, and the\n  values of [`ssh_password`](#ssh_password) and\n  [`ssh_private_key_file`](#ssh_private_key_file) will be ignored. The\n  environment variable `SSH_AUTH_SOCK` must be set for this option to work\n  properly.\n\n\n## Basic Example\n\nHere is a basic example for Tencentcloud.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"variables\": {\n    \"secret_id\": \"{{env `TENCENTCLOUD_SECRET_ID`}}\",\n    \"secret_key\": \"{{env `TENCENTCLOUD_SECRET_KEY`}}\"\n  },\n  \"builders\": [\n    {\n      \"type\": \"tencentcloud-cvm\",\n
