Packer supports\nthe following Parallels builders:\n\n- [parallels-iso](/docs/builders/parallels-iso.mdx) - Starts from an ISO\n  file, creates a brand new Parallels VM, installs an OS, provisions software\n  within the OS, then exports that machine to create an image. This is best\n  for people who want to start from scratch.\n\n- [parallels-pvm](/docs/builders/parallels-pvm.mdx) - This builder imports\n  an existing PVM file, runs provisioners on top of that VM, and exports that\n  machine to create an image. This is best if you have an existing Parallels\n  VM export you want to use as the source. As an additional benefit, you can\n  feed the artifact of this builder back into itself to iterate on a machine.\n\n## Requirements\n\nIn addition to [Parallels Desktop for\nMac](https://www.parallels.com/products/desktop/) this requires the [Parallels\nVirtualization SDK](https://www.parallels.com/downloads/desktop/).\n\nThe SDK can be installed by downloading and following the instructions in the\ndmg.\n\nParallels Desktop for Mac 9 and later is supported, from PD 11 Pro or Business\nedition is required.\n\n## Installation\n\n### Using pre-built releases\n\n#### Using the `packer init` command\n\nStarting from version 1.7, Packer supports a new `packer init` command allowing\nautomatic installation of Packer plugins. Read the\n[Packer documentation](https://www.packer.io/docs/commands/init) for more information.\n\nTo install this plugin, copy and paste this code into your Packer configuration .\nThen, run [`packer init`](https://www.packer.io/docs/commands/init).\n\n```hcl\npacker {\n  required_plugins {\n    parallels = {\n      version = \">= 1.0.0\"\n      source  = \"github.com/hashicorp/parallels\"\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n#### Manual installation\n\nYou can find pre-built binary releases of the plugin [here](https://github.com/hashicorp/packer-plugin-name/releases).\nOnce you have downloaded the latest archive corresponding to your target OS,\nuncompress it to retrieve the plugin binary file corresponding to your platform.\nTo install the plugin, please follow the Packer documentation on\n[installing a plugin](https://www.packer.io/docs/extending/plugins/#installing-plugins).\n\n\n#### From Source\n\nIf you prefer to build the plugin from its source code, clone the GitHub\nrepository locally and run the command `go build` from the root\ndirectory. Upon successful compilation, a `packer-plugin-parallels` plugin\nbinary file can be found in the root directory.\nTo install the compiled plugin, please follow the official Packer documentation\non [installing a plugin](https://www.packer.io/docs/extending/plugins/#installing-plugins).","created_at":"2023-06-15T20:50:57.521Z","updated_at":"2023-06-15T20:50:57.521Z","components":[{"id":"7b09ea46-a65a-4625-97d0-38023a60f3c5","integration_release_id":"9a2db38a-a2d4-4766-b96f-e528ea2b24c9","component_id":"36076511-3ced-4faf-addf-101fce0405ff","readme":"Type: `parallels-pvm`\nArtifact BuilderId: `packer.parallels`\n\nThis Parallels builder is able to create [Parallels Desktop for\nMac](https://www.parallels.com/products/desktop/) virtual machines and export\nthem in the PVM format, starting from an existing PVM (exported virtual machine\nimage).\n\nThe builder builds a virtual machine by importing an existing PVM file. It then\nboots this image, runs provisioners on this new VM, and exports that VM to\ncreate the image. The imported machine is deleted prior to finishing the build.\n\n## Basic Example\n\nHere is a basic example. This example is functional if you have an PVM matching\nthe settings here.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"type\": \"parallels-pvm\",\n  \"parallels_tools_flavor\": \"lin\",\n  \"source_path\": \"source.pvm\",\n  \"ssh_username\": \"packer\",\n  \"ssh_password\": \"packer\",\n  \"ssh_timeout\": \"30s\",\n  \"shutdown_command\": \"echo 'packer' | sudo -S shutdown -P now\"\n}\n```\n\nIt is important to add a `shutdown_command`. By default Packer halts the virtual\nmachine and the file system may not be sync'd. Thus, changes made in a\nprovisioner might not be saved.\n\n## Configuration Reference\n\nThere are many configuration options available for the Parallels builder. They\nare organized below into two categories: required and optional. Within each\ncategory, the available options are alphabetized and described.\n\nIn addition to the options listed here, a\n[communicator](/packer/docs/templates/legacy_json_templates/communicator) can be configured for this\nbuilder. In addition to the options defined there, a private key file\ncan also be supplied to override the typical auto-generated key:\n\n- `ssh_private_key_file` (string) - Path to a PEM encoded private key file to use to authenticate with SSH.\n  The `~` can be used in path and will be expanded to the home directory\n  of current user.\n\n\n### Required:\n\n- `parallels_tools_flavor` (string) - The flavor of the Parallels Tools ISO to\n  install into the VM. Valid values are \"win\", \"lin\", \"mac\", \"os2\"\n  and \"other\". This can be omitted only if `parallels_tools_mode`\n  is \"disable\".\n\n- `source_path` (string) - The path to a PVM directory that acts as the source\n  of this build.\n\n### Optional:\n\n- `boot_command` (array of strings) - This is an array of commands to type\n  when the virtual machine is first booted. The goal of these commands should\n  be to type just enough to initialize the operating system installer. Special\n  keys can be typed as well, and are covered in the section below on the\n  boot command. If this is not specified, it is assumed the installer will\n  start itself.\n\n- `boot_wait` (string) - The time to wait after booting the initial virtual\n  machine before typing the `boot_command`. The value of this should be\n  a duration. Examples are \"5s\" and \"1m30s\" which will cause Packer to wait\n  five seconds and one minute 30 seconds, respectively. If this isn't\n  specified, the default is 10 seconds.\n\n- `floppy_files` (array of strings) - A list of files to place onto a floppy\n  disk that is attached when the VM is booted. This is most useful for\n  unattended Windows installs, which look for an `Autounattend.xml` file on\n  removable media. By default, no floppy will be attached. All files listed in\n  this setting get placed into the root directory of the floppy and the floppy\n  is attached as the first floppy device. Currently, no support exists for\n  creating sub-directories on the floppy. Wildcard characters (\\*, ?,\n  and \\[\\]) are allowed. Directory names are also allowed, which will add all\n  the files found in the directory to the floppy.\n\n- `floppy_dirs` (array of strings) - A list of directories to place onto\n  the floppy disk recursively. This is similar to the `floppy_files` option\n  except that the directory structure is preserved. This is useful for when\n  your floppy disk includes drivers or if you just want to organize it's\n  contents as a hierarchy. Wildcard characters (\\*, ?, and \\[\\]) are allowed.\n\n- `floppy_label` (string) - The label to use for the floppy disk that\n  is attached when the VM is booted. This is most useful for cloud-init,\n  Kickstart or other early initialization tools, which can benefit from labelled floppy disks.\n  By default, the floppy label will be 'packer'.\n\n- `output_directory` (string) - This is the path to the directory where the\n  resulting virtual machine will be created. This may be relative or absolute.\n  If relative, the path is relative to the working directory when `packer`\n  is executed. This directory must not exist or be empty prior to running\n  the builder. By default this is \"output-BUILDNAME\" where \"BUILDNAME\" is the\n  name of the build.\n\n- `parallels_tools_guest_path` (string) - The path in the VM to upload\n  Parallels Tools. This only takes effect if `parallels_tools_mode`\n  is \"upload\". This is a [configuration\n  template](/packer/docs/templates/legacy_json_templates/engine) that has a single\n  valid variable: `Flavor`, which will be the value of\n  `parallels_tools_flavor`. By default this is `prl-tools-{{.Flavor}}.iso`\n  which should upload into the login directory of the user.\n\n- `parallels_tools_mode` (string) - The method by which Parallels Tools are\n  made available to the guest for installation. Valid options are \"upload\",\n  \"attach\", or \"disable\". If the mode is \"attach\" the Parallels Tools ISO will\n  be attached as a CD device to the virtual machine. If the mode is \"upload\"\n  the Parallels Tools ISO will be uploaded to the path specified by\n  `parallels_tools_guest_path`. The default value is \"upload\".\n\n- `prlctl` (array of array of strings) - Custom `prlctl` commands to execute\n  in order to further customize the virtual machine being created. The value\n  of this is an array of commands to execute. The commands are executed in the\n  order defined in the template. For each command, the command is defined\n  itself as an array of strings, where each string represents a single\n  argument on the command-line to `prlctl` (but excluding `prlctl` itself).\n  Each arg is treated as a [configuration\n  template](/packer/docs/templates/legacy_json_templates/engine), where the `Name`\n  variable is replaced with the VM name. More details on how to use `prlctl`\n  are below.\n\n- `prlctl_post` (array of array of strings) - Identical to `prlctl`, except\n  that it is run after the virtual machine is shutdown, and before the virtual\n  machine is exported.\n\n- `prlctl_version_file` (string) - The path within the virtual machine to\n  upload a file that contains the `prlctl` version that was used to create\n  the machine. This information can be useful for provisioning. By default\n  this is \".prlctl_version\", which will generally upload it into the\n  home directory.\n\n- `reassign_mac` (boolean) - If this is \"false\" the MAC address of the first\n  NIC will reused when imported else a new MAC address will be generated\n  by Parallels. Defaults to \"false\".\n\n- `shutdown_command` (string) - The command to use to gracefully shut down the\n  machine once all the provisioning is done. By default this is an empty\n  string, which tells Packer to just forcefully shut down the machine.\n\n- `shutdown_timeout` (string) - The amount of time to wait after executing the\n  `shutdown_command` for the virtual machine to actually shut down. If it\n  doesn't shut down in this time, it is an error. By default, the timeout is\n  \"5m\", or five minutes.\n\n- `skip_compaction` (boolean) - Virtual disk image is compacted at the end of\n  the build process using `prl_disk_tool` utility. In certain rare cases, this\n  might corrupt the resulting disk image. If you find this to be the case,\n  you can disable compaction using this configuration value.\n\n- `vm_name` (string) - This is the name of the virtual machine when it is\n  imported as well as the name of the PVM directory when the virtual machine\n  is exported. By default this is \"packer-BUILDNAME\", where \"BUILDNAME\" is the\n  name of the build.\n\n## Parallels Tools\n\nAfter the virtual machine is up and the operating system is installed, Packer\nuploads the Parallels Tools into the virtual machine. The path where they are\nuploaded is controllable by `parallels_tools_path`, and defaults to\n\"prl-tools.iso\". Without an absolute path, it is uploaded to the home directory\nof the SSH user. Parallels Tools ISO's can be found in: \"/Applications/Parallels\nDesktop.app/Contents/Resources/Tools/\"\n\n## Boot Command\n\nThe `boot_command` specifies the keys to type when the virtual machine is first\nbooted. This command is typed after `boot_wait`.\n\nAs documented above, the `boot_command` is an array of strings. The strings are\nall typed in sequence. It is an array only to improve readability within the\ntemplate.\n\nThe boot command is \"typed\" character for character (using the Parallels\nVirtualization SDK, see [Parallels Builder](/packer/integrations/BrandonRomano/parallels))\nsimulating a human actually typing the keyboard.\n\nThere are a set of special keys available. If these are in your boot\ncommand, they will be replaced by the proper key:\n\n- `<bs>` - Backspace\n\n- `<del>` - Delete\n\n- `<enter> <return>` - Simulates an actual \"enter\" or \"return\" keypress.\n\n- `<esc>` - Simulates pressing the escape key.\n\n- `<tab>` - Simulates pressing the tab key.\n\n- `<f1> - <f12>` - Simulates pressing a function key.\n\n- `<up> <down> <left> <right>` - Simulates pressing an arrow key.\n\n- `<spacebar>` - Simulates pressing the spacebar.\n\n- `<insert>` - Simulates pressing the insert key.\n\n- `<home> <end>` - Simulates pressing the home and end keys.\n\n- `<pageUp> <pageDown>` - Simulates pressing the page up and page down keys.\n\n- `<menu>` - Simulates pressing the Menu key.\n\n- `<leftAlt> <rightAlt>` - Simulates pressing the alt key.\n\n- `<leftCtrl> <rightCtrl>` - Simulates pressing the ctrl key.\n\n- `<leftShift> <rightShift>` - Simulates pressing the shift key.\n\n- `<leftSuper> <rightSuper>` - Simulates pressing the ⌘ or Windows key.\n\n- `<wait> <wait5> <wait10>` - Adds a 1, 5 or 10 second pause before\n  sending any additional keys. This is useful if you have to generally wait\n  for the UI to update before typing more.\n\n- `<waitXX>` - Add an arbitrary pause before sending any additional keys. The\n  format of `XX` is a sequence of positive decimal numbers, each with\n  optional fraction and a unit suffix, such as `300ms`, `1.5h` or `2h45m`.\n  Valid time units are `ns`, `us` (or `µs`), `ms`, `s`, `m`, `h`. For example\n  `<wait10m>` or `<wait1m20s>`\n\n### On/Off variants\n\nAny printable keyboard character, and of these \"special\" expressions, with the\nexception of the `<wait>` types, can also be toggled on or off. For example, to\nsimulate ctrl+c, use `<leftCtrlOn>c<leftCtrlOff>`. Be sure to release them,\notherwise they will be held down until the machine reboots.\n\nTo hold the `c` key down, you would use `<cOn>`. Likewise, `<cOff>` to release.\n\n### Templates inside boot command\n\nIn addition to the special keys, each command to type is treated as a\n[template engine](/packer/docs/templates/legacy_json_templates/engine). The\navailable variables are:\n\n- `HTTPIP` and `HTTPPort` - The IP and port, respectively of an HTTP server\n  that is started serving the directory specified by the `http_directory`\n  configuration parameter or the content specified in the `http_content` map. If\n  `http_directory` or `http_content` isn't specified, these will be blank!\n- `Name` - The name of the VM.\n\nFor more examples of various boot commands, see the sample projects from our\n[community templates page](/community-tools#templates).\n\n\n## prlctl Commands\n\nIn order to perform extra customization of the virtual machine, a template can\ndefine extra calls to `prlctl` to perform.\n[prlctl](http://download.parallels.com/desktop/v9/ga/docs/en_US/Parallels%20Command%20Line%20Reference%20Guide.pdf)\nis the command-line interface to Parallels Desktop. It can be used to configure\nthe virtual machine, such as set RAM, CPUs, etc.\n\nExtra `prlctl` commands are defined in the template in the `prlctl` section. An\nexample is shown below that sets the memory and number of CPUs within the\nvirtual machine:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prlctl\": [\n    [\"set\", \"{{.Name}}\", \"--memsize\", \"1024\"],\n    [\"set\", \"{{.Name}}\", \"--cpus\", \"2\"]\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nThe value of `prlctl` is an array of commands to execute. These commands are\nexecuted in the order defined. So in the above example, the memory will be set\nfollowed by the CPUs.\n\nEach command itself is an array of strings, where each string is an argument to\n`prlctl`. Each argument is treated as a [configuration\ntemplate](/packer/docs/templates/legacy_json_templates/engine). The only available\nvariable is `Name` which is replaced with the unique name of the VM, which is\nrequired for many `prlctl` calls.\n","created_at":"2023-06-15T20:50:57.822Z","updated_at":"2023-06-15T20:50:57.822Z","name":"Parallels PVM","slug":"pvm","component":{"id":"36076511-3ced-4faf-addf-101fce0405ff","slug":"builder","name":"Builder","plural_name":"Builders","product_id":"4c2b00c6-7cc1-4e4c-b596-4ab57e319f21","created_at":"2022-11-09T22:56:30.937Z","updated_at":"2022-11-09T22:56:30.937Z"},"variable_groups":[]},{"id":"c2117b53-9c38-4dd8-a94d-ccae317b888f","integration_release_id":"9a2db38a-a2d4-4766-b96f-e528ea2b24c9","component_id":"36076511-3ced-4faf-addf-101fce0405ff","readme":"Type: `parallels-iso`\nArtifact BuilderId: `packer.parallels`\n\nThe Parallels Packer builder is able to create [Parallels Desktop for\nMac](https://www.parallels.com/products/desktop/) virtual machines and export\nthem in the PVM format, starting from an ISO image.\n\nThe builder builds a virtual machine by creating a new virtual machine from\nscratch, booting it, installing an OS, provisioning software within the OS, then\nshutting it down.

Here is a\n  list of valid checksum values:\n   * md5:090992ba9fd140077b0661cb75f7ce13\n   * 090992ba9fd140077b0661cb75f7ce13\n   * sha1:ebfb681885ddf1234c18094a45bbeafd91467911\n   * ebfb681885ddf1234c18094a45bbeafd91467911\n   * sha256:ed363350696a726b7932db864dda019bd2017365c9e299627830f06954643f93\n   * ed363350696a726b7932db864dda019bd2017365c9e299627830f06954643f93\n   * file:http://releases.ubuntu.com/20.04/SHA256SUMS\n   * file:file://./local/path/file.sum\n   * file:./local/path/file.sum\n   * none\n  Although the checksum will not be verified when it is set to \"none\",\n  this is not recommended since these files can be very large and\n  corruption does happen from time to time.\n\n- `iso_url` (string) - A URL to the ISO containing the installation image or virtual hard drive\n  (VHD or VHDX) file to clone.\n\n<!-- End of code generated from the comments of the ISOConfig struct in multistep/commonsteps/iso_config.go; -->\n\n\n### Optional:\n\n<!-- Code generated from the comments of the ISOConfig struct in multistep/commonsteps/iso_config.go; DO NOT EDIT MANUALLY -->\n\n- `iso_urls` ([]string) - Multiple URLs for the ISO to download. Packer will try these in order.\n  If anything goes wrong attempting to download or while downloading a\n  single URL, it will move on to the next. All URLs must point to the same\n  file (same checksum). By default this is empty and `iso_url` is used.\n  Only one of `iso_url` or `iso_urls` can be specified.\n\n- `iso_target_path` (string) - The path where the iso should be saved after download. By default will\n  go in the packer cache, with a hash of the original filename and\n  checksum as its name.\n\n- `iso_target_extension` (string) - The extension of the iso file after download. This defaults to `iso`.\n\n<!-- End of code generated from the comments of the ISOConfig struct in multistep/commonsteps/iso_config.go; -->\n\n\n### Required:\n\n- `parallels_tools_flavor` (string) - The flavor of the Parallels Tools ISO to\n  install into the VM. Valid values are \"win\", \"win-arm\", \"lin\", \"lin-arm\", \"mac\", \n  \"mac-arm\", \"os2\" and \"other\". This can be omitted only if `parallels_tools_mode`\n  is \"disable\".\n\n### Optional:\n\n- `boot_command` (array of strings) - This is an array of commands to type\n  when the virtual machine is first booted. The goal of these commands should\n  be to type just enough to initialize the operating system installer. Special\n  keys can be typed as well, and are covered in the section below on the\n  boot command. If this is not specified, it is assumed the installer will\n  start itself.\n\n- `boot_wait` (string) - The time to wait after booting the initial virtual\n  machine before typing the `boot_command`. The value of this should be\n  a duration. Examples are \"5s\" and \"1m30s\" which will cause Packer to wait\n  five seconds and one minute 30 seconds, respectively. If this isn't\n  specified, the default is 10 seconds.\n\n- `cpus` (number) - The number of cpus to use for building the VM.\n  Defaults to `1`.\n\n- `disk_size` (number) - The size, in megabytes, of the hard disk to create\n  for the VM. By default, this is 40000 (about 40 GB).\n\n- `disk_type` (string) - The type for image file based virtual disk drives,\n  defaults to `expand`. Valid options are `expand` (expanding disk) that the\n  image file is small initially and grows in size as you add data to it, and\n  `plain` (plain disk) that the image file has a fixed size from the moment it\n  is created (i.e the space is allocated for the full drive). Plain disks\n  perform faster than expanding disks. `skip_compaction` will be set to true\n  automatically for plain disks.\n\n- `floppy_files` (array of strings) - A list of files to place onto a floppy\n  disk that is attached when the VM is booted. This is most useful for\n  unattended Windows installs, which look for an `Autounattend.xml` file on\n  removable media. By default, no floppy will be attached. All files listed in\n  this setting get placed into the root directory of the floppy and the floppy\n  is attached as the first floppy device. Currently, no support exists for\n  creating sub-directories on the floppy. Wildcard characters (\\*, ?,\n  and \\[\\]) are allowed. Directory names are also allowed, which will add all\n  the files found in the directory to the floppy.\n\n- `floppy_dirs` (array of strings) - A list of directories to place onto\n  the floppy disk recursively. This is similar to the `floppy_files` option\n  except that the directory structure is preserved. This is useful for when\n  your floppy disk includes drivers or if you just want to organize it's\n  contents as a hierarchy. Wildcard characters (\\*, ?, and \\[\\]) are allowed.\n\n- `floppy_label` (string) - The label to use for the floppy disk that\n  is attached when the VM is booted. This is most useful for cloud-init,\n  Kickstart or other early initialization tools, which can benefit from labelled floppy disks.\n  By default, the floppy label will be 'packer'.\n\n- `guest_os_type` (string) - The guest OS type being installed. By default\n  this is \"other\", but you can get _dramatic_ performance improvements by\n  setting this to the proper value. To view all available values for this run\n  `prlctl create x --distribution list`. Setting the correct value hints to\n  Parallels Desktop how to optimize the virtual hardware to work best with\n  that operating system.\n\n- `hard_drive_interface` (string) - The type of controller that the hard\n  drives are attached to, defaults to \"sata\". Valid options are \"sata\", \"ide\",\n  and \"scsi\".\n\n- `host_interfaces` (array of strings) - A list of which interfaces on the\n  host should be searched for a IP address. The first IP address found on one\n  of these will be used as `{{ .HTTPIP }}` in the `boot_command`. Defaults to\n  \\[\"en0\", \"en1\", \"en2\", \"en3\", \"en4\", \"en5\", \"en6\", \"en7\", \"en8\", \"en9\",\n  \"ppp0\", \"ppp1\", \"ppp2\"\\].\n\n- `memory` (number) - The amount of memory to use for building the VM in\n  megabytes. Defaults to `512` megabytes.\n\n- `output_directory` (string) - This is the path to the directory where the\n  resulting virtual machine will be created. This may be relative or absolute.\n  If relative, the path is relative to the working directory when `packer`\n  is executed. This directory must not exist or be empty prior to running\n  the builder. By default this is \"output-BUILDNAME\" where \"BUILDNAME\" is the\n  name of the build.\n\n- `parallels_tools_guest_path` (string) - The path in the virtual machine to\n  upload Parallels Tools. This only takes effect if `parallels_tools_mode`\n  is \"upload\". This is a [configuration\n  template](/packer/docs/templates/legacy_json_templates/engine) that has a single\n  valid variable: `Flavor`, which will be the value of\n  `parallels_tools_flavor`. By default this is `prl-tools-{{.Flavor}}.iso`\n  which should upload into the login directory of the user.\n\n- `parallels_tools_mode` (string) - The method by which Parallels Tools are\n  made available to the guest for installation. Valid options are \"upload\",\n  \"attach\", or \"disable\". If the mode is \"attach\" the Parallels Tools ISO will\n  be attached as a CD device to the virtual machine. If the mode is \"upload\"\n  the Parallels Tools ISO will be uploaded to the path specified by\n  `parallels_tools_guest_path`. The default value is \"upload\".\n\n- `prlctl` (array of array of strings) - Custom `prlctl` commands to execute\n  in order to further customize the virtual machine being created. The value\n  of this is an array of commands to execute. The commands are executed in the\n  order defined in the template. For each command, the command is defined\n  itself as an array of strings, where each string represents a single\n  argument on the command-line to `prlctl` (but excluding `prlctl` itself).\n  Each arg is treated as a [configuration\n  template](/packer/docs/templates/legacy_json_templates/engine), where the `Name`\n  variable is replaced with the VM name. More details on how to use `prlctl`\n  are below.\n\n- `prlctl_post` (array of array of strings) - Identical to `prlctl`, except\n  that it is run after the virtual machine is shutdown, and before the virtual\n  machine is exported.\n\n- `prlctl_version_file` (string) - The path within the virtual machine to\n  upload a file that contains the `prlctl` version that was used to create\n  the machine. This information can be useful for provisioning. By default\n  this is \".prlctl_version\", which will generally upload it into the\n  home directory.\n\n- `shutdown_command` (string) - The command to use to gracefully shut down the\n  machine once all the provisioning is done. By default this is an empty\n  string, which tells Packer to just forcefully shut down the machine.\n\n- `sound` (boolean) - Specifies whether to enable the sound device when\n  building the VM. Defaults to `false`.\n\n- `shutdown_timeout` (string) - The amount of time to wait after executing the\n  `shutdown_command` for the virtual machine to actually shut down. If it\n  doesn't shut down in this time, it is an error. By default, the timeout is\n  \"5m\", or five minutes.\n\n- `skip_compaction` (boolean) - Virtual disk image is compacted at the end of\n  the build process using `prl_disk_tool` utility (except for the case that\n  `disk_type` is set to `plain`). In certain rare cases, this might corrupt\n  the resulting disk image. If you find this to be the case, you can disable\n  compaction using this configuration value.\n\n- `usb` (boolean) - Specifies whether to enable the USB bus when building\n  the VM. Defaults to `false`.\n\n- `vm_name` (string) - This is the name of the PVM directory for the new\n  virtual machine, without the file extension. By default this is\n  \"packer-BUILDNAME\", where \"BUILDNAME\" is the name of the build.\n\n## Http directory configuration reference\n\n<!-- Code generated from the comments of the HTTPConfig struct in multistep/commonsteps/http_config.go; DO NOT EDIT MANUALLY -->\n\nPacker will create an http server serving `http_directory` when it is set, a\nrandom free port will be selected and the architecture of the directory\nreferenced will be available in your builder.\n\nExample usage from a builder:\n\n\t`wget http://{{ .HTTPIP }}:{{ .HTTPPort }}/foo/bar/preseed.cfg`\n\n<!-- End of code generated from the comments of the HTTPConfig struct in multistep/commonsteps/http_config.go; -->\n\n\n### Optional:\n\n<!-- Code generated from the comments of the HTTPConfig struct in multistep/commonsteps/http_config.go; DO NOT EDIT MANUALLY -->\n\n- `http_directory` (string) - Path to a directory to serve using an HTTP server. The files in this\n  directory will be available over HTTP that will be requestable from the\n  virtual machine. This is useful for hosting kickstart files and so on.\n  By default this is an empty string, which means no HTTP server will be\n  started. The address and port of the HTTP server will be available as\n  variables in `boot_command`. This is covered in more detail below.\n\n- `http_content` (map[string]string) - Key/Values to serve using an HTTP server. `http_content` works like and\n  conflicts with `http_directory`. The keys represent the paths and the\n  values contents, the keys must start with a slash, ex: `/path/to/file`.\n  `http_content` is useful for hosting kickstart files and so on. By\n  default this is empty, which means no HTTP server will be started. The\n  address and port of the HTTP server will be available as variables in\n  `boot_command`. This is covered in more detail below.\n  Example:\n  ```hcl\n    http_content = {\n      \"/a/b\"     = file(\"http/b\")\n      \"/foo/bar\" = templatefile(\"${path.root}/preseed.cfg\", { packages = [\"nginx\"] })\n    }\n  ```\n\n- `http_port_min` (int) - These are the minimum and maximum port to use for the HTTP server\n  started to serve the `http_directory`. Because Packer often runs in\n  parallel, Packer will choose a randomly available port in this range to\n  run the HTTP server. If you want to force the HTTP server to be on one\n  port, make this minimum and maximum port the same. By default the values\n  are `8000` and `9000`, respectively.\n\n- `http_port_max` (int) - HTTP Port Max\n\n- `http_bind_address` (string) - This is the bind address for the HTTP server. Defaults to 0.0.0.0 so that\n  it will work with any network interface.\n\n<!-- End of code generated from the comments of the HTTPConfig struct in multistep/commonsteps/http_config.go; -->\n\n\n## Boot Command\n\nThe `boot_command` configuration is very important: it specifies the keys to\ntype when the virtual machine is first booted in order to start the OS\ninstaller. This command is typed after `boot_wait`, which gives the virtual\nmachine some time to actually load the ISO.\n\nAs documented above, the `boot_command` is an array of strings. The strings are\nall typed in sequence. It is an array only to improve readability within the\ntemplate.\n\nThe boot command is \"typed\" character for character (using the Parallels\nVirtualization SDK, see [Parallels Builder](/packer/plugin/builder/parallels))\nsimulating a human actually typing the keyboard.\n\nThere are a set of special keys available. If these are in your boot\ncommand, they will be replaced by the proper key:\n\n- `<bs>` - Backspace\n\n- `<del>` - Delete\n\n- `<enter> <return>` - Simulates an actual \"enter\" or \"return\" keypress.\n\n- `<esc>` - Simulates pressing the escape key.\n\n- `<tab>` - Simulates pressing the tab key.\n\n- `<f1> - <f12>` - Simulates pressing a function key.\n\n- `<up> <down> <left> <right>` - Simulates pressing an arrow key.\n\n- `<spacebar>` - Simulates pressing the spacebar.\n\n- `<insert>` - Simulates pressing the insert key.\n\n- `<home> <end>` - Simulates pressing the home and end keys.\n\n- `<pageUp> <pageDown>` - Simulates pressing the page up and page down keys.\n\n- `<menu>` - Simulates pressing the Menu key.\n\n- `<leftAlt> <rightAlt>` - Simulates pressing the alt key.\n\n- `<leftCtrl> <rightCtrl>` - Simulates pressing the ctrl key.\n\n- `<leftShift> <rightShift>` - Simulates pressing the shift key.\n\n- `<leftSuper> <rightSuper>` - Simulates pressing the ⌘ or Windows key.\n\n- `<wait> <wait5> <wait10>` - Adds a 1, 5 or 10 second pause before\n  sending any additional keys. This is useful if you have to generally wait\n  for the UI to update before typing more.\n\n- `<waitXX>` - Add an arbitrary pause before sending any additional keys. The\n  format of `XX` is a sequence of positive decimal numbers, each with\n  optional fraction and a unit suffix, such as `300ms`, `1.5h` or `2h45m`.\n  Valid time units are `ns`, `us` (or `µs`), `ms`, `s`, `m`, `h`. For example\n  `<wait10m>` or `<wait1m20s>`\n\n### On/Off variants\n\nAny printable keyboard character, and of these \"special\" expressions, with the\nexception of the `<wait>` types, can also be toggled on or off. For example, to\nsimulate ctrl+c, use `<leftCtrlOn>c<leftCtrlOff>`. Be sure to release them,\notherwise they will be held down until the machine reboots.\n\nTo hold the `c` key down, you would use `<cOn>`. Likewise, `<cOff>` to release.\n\n### Templates inside boot command\n\nIn addition to the special keys, each command to type is treated as a\n[template engine](/packer/docs/templates/legacy_json_templates/engine). The\navailable variables are:\n\n- `HTTPIP` and `HTTPPort` - The IP and port, respectively of an HTTP server\n  that is started serving the directory specified by the `http_directory`\n  configuration parameter or the content specified in the `http_content` map. If\n  `http_directory` or `http_content` isn't specified, these will be blank!\n- `Name` - The name of the VM.\n\nFor more examples of various boot commands, see the sample projects from our\n[community templates page](/community-tools#templates).\n\n\nExample boot command. This is actually a working boot command used to start an\nUbuntu 12.04 installer:\n\n```text\n[\n  \"<esc><esc><enter><wait>\",\n  \"/install/vmlinuz noapic \",\n  \"preseed/url=http://{{ .HTTPIP }}:{{ .HTTPPort }}/preseed.cfg \",\n  \"debian-installer=en_US auto locale=en_US kbd-chooser/method=us \",\n  \"hostname={{ .Name }} \",\n  \"fb=false debconf/frontend=noninteractive \",\n  \"keyboard-configuration/modelcode=SKIP keyboard-configuration/layout=USA \",\n  \"keyboard-configuration/variant=USA console-setup/ask_detect=false \",\n  \"initrd=/install/initrd.gz -- <enter>;\"\n]\n```\n\nFor more examples of various boot commands, see the sample projects from our\n[community templates page](/community-tools#templates).\n\n## prlctl Commands\n\nIn order to perform extra customization of the virtual machine, a template can\ndefine extra calls to `prlctl` to perform.\n[prlctl](http://download.parallels.com/desktop/v9/ga/docs/en_US/Parallels%20Command%20Line%20Reference%20Guide.pdf)\nis the command-line interface to Parallels Desktop. It can be used to configure\nthe advanced virtual machine options.\n\nExtra `prlctl` commands are defined in the template in the `prlctl` section. In the\nexample below `prlctl` is used to explicitly enable the adaptive hypervisor, and\ndisable 3d acceleration:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prlctl\": [\n    [\"set\", \"{{.Name}}\", \"--3d-accelerate\", \"off\"],\n    [\"set\", \"{{.Name}}\", \"--adaptive-hypervisor\", \"on\"]\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nThe value of `prlctl` is an array of commands to execute. These commands are\nexecuted in the order defined. So in the above example, 3d acceleration will be disabled\nfirst, followed by the command which enables the adaptive hypervisor.\n\nEach command itself is an array of strings, where each string is an argument to\n`prlctl`. Each argument is treated as a [template engine](/packer/docs/templates/legacy_json_templates/engine). The only available\nvariable is `Name` which is replaced with the unique name of the VM, which is\nrequired for many `prlctl` calls.\n","created_at":"2023-06-15T20:50:57.894Z","updated_at":"2023-06-15T20:50:57.894Z","name":"Parallels ISO","slug":"iso","component":{"id":"36076511-3ced-4faf-addf-101fce0405ff","slug":"builder","name":"Builder","plural_name":"Builders","product_id":"4c2b00c6-7cc1-4e4c-b596-4ab57e319f21","created_at":"2022-11-09T22:56:30.937Z","updated_at":"2022-11-09T22:56:30.937Z"},"variable_groups":[]}]},"component":{"id":"c2117b53-9c38-4dd8-a94d-ccae317b888f","integration_release_id":"9a2db38a-a2d4-4766-b96f-e528ea2b24c9","component_id":"36076511-3ced-4faf-addf-101fce0405ff","readme":"Type: `parallels-iso`\nArtifact BuilderId: `packer.parallels`\n\nThe Parallels Packer builder is able to create [Parallels Desktop for\nMac](https://www.parallels.com/products/desktop/) virtual machines and export\nthem in the PVM format, starting from an ISO image.\n\nThe builder builds a virtual machine by creating a new virtual machine from\nscratch, booting it, installing an OS, provisioning software within the OS, then\nshutting it down. The result of the Parallels builder is a directory containing\nall the files necessary to run the virtual machine portably.\n\n## Basic Example\n\nHere is a basic example. This example is not functional. It will start the OS\ninstaller but then fail because we don't provide the preseed file for Ubuntu to\nself-install. Still, the example serves to show the basic configuration:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"type\": \"parallels-iso\",\n  \"guest_os_type\": \"ubuntu\",\n  \"iso_url\": \"http://releases.ubuntu.com/12.04/ubuntu-12.04.3-server-amd64.iso\",\n  \"iso_checksum\": \"2cbe868812a871242cdcdd8f2fd6feb9\",\n  \"parallels_tools_flavor\": \"lin\",\n  \"ssh_username\": \"packer\",\n  \"ssh_password\": \"packer\",\n  \"ssh_timeout\": \"30s\",\n  \"shutdown_command\": \"echo 'packer' | sudo -S shutdown -P now\"\n}\n```\n\nIt is important to add a `shutdown_command`. By default Packer halts the virtual\nmachine and the file system may not be sync'd. Thus, changes made in a\nprovisioner might not be saved.\n\n## Configuration Reference\n\nThere are many configuration options available for the Parallels builder. They\nare organized below into two categories: required and optional. Within each\ncategory, the available options are alphabetized and described.\n\nIn addition to the options listed here, a\n[communicator](/packer/docs/templates/legacy_json_templates/communicator) can be configured for this\nbuilder. In addition to the options defined there, a private key file\ncan also be supplied to override the typical auto-generated key:\n\n- `ssh_private_key_file` (string) - Path to a PEM encoded private key file to use to authenticate with SSH.\n  The `~` can be used in path and will be expanded to the home directory\n  of current user.\n\n\n## ISO Configuration Reference\n\n<!-- Code generated from the comments of the ISOConfig struct in multistep/commonsteps/iso_config.go; DO NOT EDIT MANUALLY -->\n\nBy default, Packer will symlink, download or copy image files to the Packer\ncache into a \"`hash($iso_url+$iso_checksum).$iso_target_extension`\" file.\nPacker uses [hashicorp/go-getter](https://github.com/hashicorp/go-getter) in\nfile mode in order to perform a download.\n\ngo-getter supports the following protocols:\n\n* Local files\n* Git\n* Mercurial\n* HTTP\n* Amazon S3\n\nExamples:\ngo-getter can guess the checksum type based on `iso_checksum` length, and it is\nalso possible to specify the checksum type.\n\nIn JSON:\n\n```json\n\n\t\"iso_checksum\": \"946a6077af6f5f95a51f82fdc44051c7aa19f9cfc5f737954845a6050543d7c2\",\n\t\"iso_url\": \"ubuntu.org/.../ubuntu-14.04.1-server-amd64.iso\"\n\n```\n\n```json\n\n\t\"iso_checksum\": \"file:ubuntu.org/..../ubuntu-14.04.1-server-amd64.iso.sum\",\n\t\"iso_url\": \"ubuntu.org/.../ubuntu-14.04.1-server-amd64.iso\"\n\n```\n\n```json\n\n\t\"iso_checksum\": \"file://./shasums.txt\",\n\t\"iso_url\": \"ubuntu.org/.../ubuntu-14.04.1-server-amd64.iso\"\n\n```\n\n```json\n\n\t\"iso_checksum\": \"file:./shasums.txt\",\n\t\"iso_url\": \"ubuntu.org/.../ubuntu-14.04.1-server-amd64.iso\"\n\n```\n\nIn HCL2:\n\n```hcl\n\n\tiso_checksum = \"946a6077af6f5f95a51f82fdc44051c7aa19f9cfc5f737954845a6050543d7c2\"\n\tiso_url = \"ubuntu.org/.../ubuntu-14.04.1-server-amd64.iso\"\n\n```\n\n```hcl\n\n\tiso_checksum = \"file:ubuntu.org/..../ubuntu-14.04.1-server-amd64.iso.sum\"\n\tiso_url = \"ubuntu.org/.../ubuntu-14.04.1-server-amd64.iso\"\n\n```\n\n```hcl\n\n\tiso_checksum = \"file://./shasums.txt\"\n\tiso_url = \"ubuntu.org/.../ubuntu-14.04.1-server-amd64.iso\"\n\n```\n\n```hcl\n\n\tiso_checksum = \"file:./shasums.txt\",\n\tiso_url = \"ubuntu.org/.../ubuntu-14.04.1-server-amd64.iso\"\n\n```\n\n<!-- End of code generated from the comments of the ISOConfig struct in multistep/commonsteps/iso_config.go; -->\n\n\n### Required:\n\n<!-- Code generated from the comments of the ISOConfig struct in multistep/commonsteps/iso_config.go; DO NOT EDIT MANUALLY -->\n\n- `iso_checksum` (string) - The checksum for the ISO file or virtual hard drive file.

All URLs must point to the same\n  file (same checksum). By default this is empty and `iso_url` is used.\n  Only one of `iso_url` or `iso_urls` can be specified.\n\n- `iso_target_path` (string) - The path where the iso should be saved after download. By default will\n  go in the packer cache, with a hash of the original filename and\n  checksum as its name.\n\n- `iso_target_extension` (string) - The extension of the iso file after download. This defaults to `iso`.\n\n<!-- End of code generated from the comments of the ISOConfig struct in multistep/commonsteps/iso_config.go; -->\n\n\n### Required:\n\n- `parallels_tools_flavor` (string) - The flavor of the Parallels Tools ISO to\n  install into the VM. Valid values are \"win\", \"win-arm\", \"lin\", \"lin-arm\", \"mac\", \n  \"mac-arm\", \"os2\" and \"other\". This can be omitted only if `parallels_tools_mode`\n  is \"disable\".\n\n### Optional:\n\n- `boot_command` (array of strings) - This is an array of commands to type\n  when the virtual machine is first booted. The goal of these commands should\n  be to type just enough to initialize the operating system installer. Special\n  keys can be typed as well, and are covered in the section below on the\n  boot command. If this is not specified, it is assumed the installer will\n  start itself.\n\n- `boot_wait` (string) - The time to wait after booting the initial virtual\n  machine before typing the `boot_command`. The value of this should be\n  a duration. Examples are \"5s\" and \"1m30s\" which will cause Packer to wait\n  five seconds and one minute 30 seconds, respectively. If this isn't\n  specified, the default is 10 seconds.\n\n- `cpus` (number) - The number of cpus to use for building the VM.\n  Defaults to `1`.\n\n- `disk_size` (number) - The size, in megabytes, of the hard disk to create\n  for the VM. By default, this is 40000 (about 40 GB).\n\n- `disk_type` (string) - The type for image file based virtual disk drives,\n  defaults to `expand`. Valid options are `expand` (expanding disk) that the\n  image file is small initially and grows in size as you add data to it, and\n  `plain` (plain disk) that the image file has a fixed size from the moment it\n  is created (i.e the space is allocated for the full drive). Plain disks\n  perform faster than expanding disks. `skip_compaction` will be set to true\n  automatically for plain disks.\n\n- `floppy_files` (array of strings) - A list of files to place onto a floppy\n  disk that is attached when the VM is booted. This is most useful for\n  unattended Windows installs, which look for an `Autounattend.xml` file on\n  removable media. By default, no floppy will be attached. All files listed in\n  this setting get placed into the root directory of the floppy and the floppy\n  is attached as the first floppy device. Currently, no support exists for\n  creating sub-directories on the floppy. Wildcard characters (\\*, ?,\n  and \\[\\]) are allowed. Directory names are also allowed, which will add all\n  the files found in the directory to the floppy.\n\n- `floppy_dirs` (array of strings) - A list of directories to place onto\n  the floppy disk recursively. This is similar to the `floppy_files` option\n  except that the directory structure is preserved. This is useful for when\n  your floppy disk includes drivers or if you just want to organize it's\n  contents as a hierarchy. Wildcard characters (\\*, ?, and \\[\\]) are allowed.\n\n- `floppy_label` (string) - The label to use for the floppy disk that\n  is attached when the VM is booted. This is most useful for cloud-init,\n  Kickstart or other early initialization tools, which can benefit from labelled floppy disks.\n  By default, the floppy label will be 'packer'.\n\n- `guest_os_type` (string) - The guest OS type being installed. By default\n  this is \"other\", but you can get _dramatic_ performance improvements by\n  setting this to the proper value. To view all available values for this run\n  `prlctl create x --distribution list`. Setting the correct value hints to\n  Parallels Desktop how to optimize the virtual hardware to work best with\n  that operating system.\n\n- `hard_drive_interface` (string) - The type of controller that the hard\n  drives are attached to, defaults to \"sata\". Valid options are \"sata\", \"ide\",\n  and \"scsi\".\n\n- `host_interfaces` (array of strings) - A list of which interfaces on the\n  host should be searched for a IP address. The first IP address found on one\n  of these will be used as `{{ .HTTPIP }}` in the `boot_command`. Defaults to\n  \\[\"en0\", \"en1\", \"en2\", \"en3\", \"en4\", \"en5\", \"en6\", \"en7\", \"en8\", \"en9\",\n  \"ppp0\", \"ppp1\", \"ppp2\"\\].\n\n- `memory` (number) - The amount of memory to use for building the VM in\n  megabytes. Defaults to `512` megabytes.\n\n- `output_directory` (string) - This is the path to the directory where the\n  resulting virtual machine will be created. This may be relative or absolute.\n  If relative, the path is relative to the working directory when `packer`\n  is executed. This directory must not exist or be empty prior to running\n  the builder. By default this is \"output-BUILDNAME\" where \"BUILDNAME\" is the\n  name of the build.\n\n- `parallels_tools_guest_path` (string) - The path in the virtual machine to\n  upload Parallels Tools. This only takes effect if `parallels_tools_mode`\n  is \"upload\". This is a [configuration\n  template](/packer/docs/templates/legacy_json_templates/engine) that has a single\n  valid variable: `Flavor`, which will be the value of\n  `parallels_tools_flavor`. By default this is `prl-tools-{{.Flavor}}.iso`\n  which should upload into the login directory of the user.\n\n- `parallels_tools_mode` (string) - The method by which Parallels Tools are\n  made available to the guest for installation. Valid options are \"upload\",\n  \"attach\", or \"disable\". If the mode is \"attach\" the Parallels Tools ISO will\n  be attached as a CD device to the virtual machine. If the mode is \"upload\"\n  the Parallels Tools ISO will be uploaded to the path specified by\n  `parallels_tools_guest_path`. The default value is \"upload\".\n\n- `prlctl` (array of array of strings) - Custom `prlctl` commands to execute\n  in order to further customize the virtual machine being created. The value\n  of this is an array of commands to execute. The commands are executed in the\n  order defined in the template. For each command, the command is defined\n  itself as an array of strings, where each string represents a single\n  argument on the command-line to `prlctl` (but excluding `prlctl` itself).\n  Each arg is treated as a [configuration\n  template](/packer/docs/templates/legacy_json_templates/engine), where the `Name`\n  variable is replaced with the VM name. More details on how to use `prlctl`\n  are below.\n\n- `prlctl_post` (array of array of strings) - Identical to `prlctl`, except\n  that it is run after the virtual machine is shutdown, and before the virtual\n  machine is exported.\n\n- `prlctl_version_file` (string) - The path within the virtual machine to\n  upload a file that contains the `prlctl` version that was used to create\n  the machine. This information can be useful for provisioning. By default\n  this is \".prlctl_version\", which will generally upload it into the\n  home directory.\n\n- `shutdown_command` (string) - The command to use to gracefully shut down the\n  machine once all the provisioning is done. By default this is an empty\n  string, which tells Packer to just forcefully shut down the machine.\n\n- `sound` (boolean) - Specifies whether to enable the sound device when\n  building the VM. Defaults to `false`.\n\n- `shutdown_timeout` (string) - The amount of time to wait after executing the\n  `shutdown_command` for the virtual machine to actually shut down. If it\n  doesn't shut down in this time, it is an error. By default, the timeout is\n  \"5m\", or five minutes.\n\n- `skip_compaction` (boolean) - Virtual disk image is compacted at the end of\n  the build process using `prl_disk_tool` utility (except for the case that\n  `disk_type` is set to `plain`). In certain rare cases, this might corrupt\n  the resulting disk image. If you find this to be the case, you can disable\n  compaction using this configuration value.\n\n- `usb` (boolean) - Specifies whether to enable the USB bus when building\n  the VM. Defaults to `false`.\n\n- `vm_name` (string) - This is the name of the PVM directory for the new\n  virtual machine, without the file extension. By default this is\n  \"packer-BUILDNAME\", where \"BUILDNAME\" is the name of the build.\n\n## Http directory configuration reference\n\n<!-- Code generated from the comments of the HTTPConfig struct in multistep/commonsteps/http_config.go; DO NOT EDIT MANUALLY -->\n\nPacker will create an http server serving `http_directory` when it is set, a\nrandom free port will be selected and the architecture of the directory\nreferenced will be available in your builder.\n\nExample usage from a builder:\n\n\t`wget http://{{ .HTTPIP }}:{{ .HTTPPort }}/foo/bar/preseed.cfg`\n\n<!-- End of code generated from the comments of the HTTPConfig struct in multistep/commonsteps/http_config.go; -->\n\n\n### Optional:\n\n<!-- Code generated from the comments of the HTTPConfig struct in multistep/commonsteps/http_config.go; DO NOT EDIT MANUALLY -->\n\n- `http_directory` (string) - Path to a directory to serve using an HTTP server. The files in this\n  directory will be available over HTTP that will be requestable from the\n  virtual machine. This is useful for hosting kickstart files and so on.\n  By default this is an empty string, which means no HTTP server will be\n  started. The address and port of the HTTP server will be available as\n  variables in `boot_command`. This is covered in more detail below.\n\n- `http_content` (map[string]string) - Key/Values to serve using an HTTP server. `http_content` works like and\n  conflicts with `http_directory`. The keys represent the paths and the\n  values contents, the keys must start with a slash, ex: `/path/to/file`.\n  `http_content` is useful for hosting kickstart files and so on. By\n  default this is empty, which means no HTTP server will be started. The\n  address and port of the HTTP server will be available as variables in\n  `boot_command`. This is covered in more detail below.\n  Example:\n  ```hcl\n    http_content = {\n      \"/a/b\"     = file(\"http/b\")\n      \"/foo/bar\" = templatefile(\"${path.root}/preseed.cfg\", { packages = [\"nginx\"] })\n    }\n  ```\n\n- `http_port_min` (int) - These are the minimum and maximum port to use for the HTTP server\n  started to serve the `http_directory`. Because Packer often runs in\n  parallel, Packer will choose a randomly available port in this range to\n  run the HTTP server. If you want to force the HTTP server to be on one\n  port, make this minimum and maximum port the same. By default the values\n  are `8000` and `9000`, respectively.\n\n- `http_port_max` (int) - HTTP Port Max\n\n- `http_bind_address` (string) - This is the bind address for the HTTP server. Defaults to 0.0.0.0 so that\n  it will work with any network interface.\n\n<!-- End of code generated from the comments of the HTTPConfig struct in multistep/commonsteps/http_config.go; -->\n\n\n## Boot Command\n\nThe `boot_command` configuration is very important: it specifies the keys to\ntype when the virtual machine is first booted in order to start the OS\ninstaller. This command is typed after `boot_wait`, which gives the virtual\nmachine some time to actually load the ISO.\n\nAs documented above, the `boot_command` is an array of strings. The strings are\nall typed in sequence. It is an array only to improve readability within the\ntemplate.\n\nThe boot command is \"typed\" character for character (using the Parallels\nVirtualization SDK, see [Parallels Builder](/packer/plugin/builder/parallels))\nsimulating a human actually typing the keyboard.\n\nThere are a set of special keys available. If these are in your boot\ncommand, they will be replaced by the proper key:\n\n- `<bs>` - Backspace\n\n- `<del>` - Delete\n\n- `<enter> <return>` - Simulates an actual \"enter\" or \"return\" keypress.\n\n- `<esc>` - Simulates pressing the escape key.\n\n- `<tab>` - Simulates pressing the tab key.\n\n- `<f1> - <f12>` - Simulates pressing a function key.\n\n- `<up> <down> <left> <right>` - Simulates pressing an arrow key.\n\n- `<spacebar>` - Simulates pressing the spacebar.\n\n- `<insert>` - Simulates pressing the insert key.\n\n- `<home> <end>` - Simulates pressing the home and end keys.\n\n- `<pageUp> <pageDown>` - Simulates pressing the page up and page down keys.\n\n- `<menu>` - Simulates pressing the Menu key.\n\n- `<leftAlt> <rightAlt>` - Simulates pressing the alt key.\n\n- `<leftCtrl> <rightCtrl>` - Simulates pressing the ctrl key.\n\n- `<leftShift> <rightShift>` - Simulates pressing the shift key.\n\n- `<leftSuper> <rightSuper>` - Simulates pressing the ⌘ or Windows key.\n\n- `<wait> <wait5> <wait10>` - Adds a 1, 5 or 10 second pause before\n  sending any additional keys. This is useful if you have to generally wait\n  for the UI to update before typing more.\n\n- `<waitXX>` - Add an arbitrary pause before sending any additional keys. The\n  format of `XX` is a sequence of positive decimal numbers, each with\n  optional fraction and a unit suffix, such as `300ms`, `1.5h` or `2h45m`.\n  Valid time units are `ns`, `us` (or `µs`), `ms`, `s`, `m`, `h`. For example\n  `<wait10m>` or `<wait1m20s>`\n\n### On/Off variants\n\nAny printable keyboard character, and of these \"special\" expressions, with the\nexception of the `<wait>` types, can also be toggled on or off. For example, to\nsimulate ctrl+c, use `<leftCtrlOn>c<leftCtrlOff>`. Be sure to release them,\notherwise they will be held down until the machine reboots.\n\nTo hold the `c` key down, you would use `<cOn>`. Likewise, `<cOff>` to release.\n\n### Templates inside boot command\n\nIn addition to the special keys, each command to type is treated as a\n[template engine](/packer/docs/templates/legacy_json_templates/engine). The\navailable variables are:\n\n- `HTTPIP` and `HTTPPort` - The IP and port, respectively of an HTTP server\n  that is started serving the directory specified by the `http_directory`\n  configuration parameter or the content specified in the `http_content` map. If\n  `http_directory` or `http_content` isn't specified, these will be blank!\n- `Name` - The name of the VM.\n\nFor more examples of various boot commands, see the sample projects from our\n[community templates page](/community-tools#templates).\n\n\nExample boot command. This is actually a working boot command used to start an\nUbuntu 12.04 installer:\n\n```text\n[\n  \"<esc><esc><enter><wait>\",\n  \"/install/vmlinuz noapic \",\n  \"preseed/url=http://{{ .HTTPIP }}:{{ .HTTPPort }}/preseed.cfg \",\n  \"debian-installer=en_US auto locale=en_US kbd-chooser/method=us \",\n  \"hostname={{ .Name }} \",\n  \"fb=false debconf/frontend=noninteractive \",\n  \"keyboard-configuration/modelcode=SKIP keyboard-configuration/layout=USA \",\n  \"keyboard-configuration/variant=USA console-setup/ask_detect=false \",\n  \"initrd=/install/initrd.gz -- <enter>;\"\n]\n```\n\nFor more examples of various boot commands, see the sample projects from our\n[community templates page](/community-tools#templates).\n\n## prlctl Commands\n\nIn order to perform extra customization of the virtual machine, a template can\ndefine extra calls to `prlctl` to perform.\n[prlctl](http://download.parallels.com/desktop/v9/ga/docs/en_US/Parallels%20Command%20Line%20Reference%20Guide.pdf)\nis the command-line interface to Parallels Desktop. It can be used to configure\nthe advanced virtual machine options.\n\nExtra `prlctl` commands are defined in the template in the `prlctl` section. In the\nexample below `prlctl` is used to explicitly enable the adaptive hypervisor, and\ndisable 3d acceleration:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prlctl\": [\n    [\"set\", \"{{.Name}}\", \"--3d-accelerate\", \"off\"],\n    [\"set\", \"{{.Name}}\", \"--adaptive-hypervisor\", \"on\"]\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nThe value of `prlctl` is an array of commands to execute. These commands are\nexecuted in the order defined. So in the above example, 3d acceleration will be disabled\nfirst, followed by the command which enables the adaptive hypervisor.\n\nEach command itself is an array of strings, where each string is an argument to\n`prlctl`. Each argument is treated as a [template engine](/packer/docs/templates/legacy_json_templates/engine). The only available\nvariable is `Name` which is replaced with the unique name of the VM, which is\nrequired for many `prlctl` calls.\n","created_at":"2023-06-15T20:50:57.894Z","updated_at":"2023-06-15T20:50:57.894Z","name":"Parallels ISO","slug":"iso","component":{"id":"36076511-3ced-4faf-addf-101fce0405ff","slug":"builder","name":"Builder","plural_name":"Builders","product_id":"4c2b00c6-7cc1-4e4c-b596-4ab57e319f21","created_at":"2022-11-09T22:56:30.937Z","updated_at":"2022-11-09T22:56:30.937Z"},"variable_groups":[]},"processedVariablesMarkdown":{},"anchorLinks":[{"id":"basic-example","level":2,"title":"Basic Example"},{"id":"configuration-reference","level":2,"title":"Configuration Reference"},{"id":"iso-configuration-reference","level":2,"title":"ISO Configuration Reference"},{"id":"required:","level":3,"title":"Required:"},{"id":"optional:","level":3,"title":"Optional:"},{"id":"required:","level":3,"title":"Required:"},{"id":"optional:","level":3,"title":"Optional:"},{"id":"http-directory-configuration-reference","level":2,"title":"Http directory configuration reference"},{"id":"optional:","level":3,"title":"Optional:"},{"id":"boot-command","level":2,"title":"Boot Command"},{"id":"onoff-variants","level":3,"title":"On/Off variants"},{"id":"templates-inside-boot-command","level":3,"title":"Templates inside boot command"},{"id":"prlctl-commands","level":2,"title":"prlctl Commands"}],"serializedREADME":{"compiledSource":"var d=Object.defineProperty,c=Object.defineProperties;var u=Object.getOwnPropertyDescriptors;var o=Object.getOwnPropertySymbols;var s=Object.prototype.hasOwnProperty,l=Object.prototype.propertyIsEnumerable;var p=(a,n,t)=>n in a?d(a,n,{enumerable:!0,configurable:!0,writable:!0,value:t}):a[n]=t,e=(a,n)=>{for(var t in n||(n={}))s.call(n,t)&&p(a,t,n[t]);if(o)for(var t of o(n))l.call(n,t)&&p(a,t,n[t]);return a},r=(a,n)=>c(a,u(n));var m=(a,n)=>{var t={};for(var i in a)s.call(a,i)&&n.indexOf(i)<0&&(t[i]=a[i]);if(a!=null&&o)for(var i of o(a))n.indexOf(i)<0&&l.call(a,i)&&(t[i]=a[i]);return t};const layoutProps={},MDXLayout=\"wrapper\";function MDXContent(t){var i=t,{components:a}=i,n=m(i,[\"components\"]);return mdx(MDXLayout,r(e(e({},layoutProps),n),{components:a,mdxType:\"MDXLayout\"}),mdx(\"p\",e({},{className:\"g-type-long-body\"}),\"Type: \",mdx(\"inlineCode\",{parentName:\"p\"},\"parallels-iso\"),`\nArtifact BuilderId: `,mdx(\"inlineCode\",{parentName:\"p\"},\"packer.parallels\")),mdx(\"p\",e({},{className:\"g-type-long-body\"}),\"The Parallels Packer builder is able to create \",mdx(\"a\",e({parentName:\"p\"},{href:\"https://www.parallels.com/products/desktop/\"}),`Parallels Desktop for\nMac`),` virtual machines and export\nthem in the PVM format, starting from an ISO image.`),mdx(\"p\",e({},{className:\"g-type-long-body\"}),`The builder builds a virtual machine by creating a new virtual machine from\nscratch, booting it, installing an OS, provisioning software within the OS, then\nshutting it down.
