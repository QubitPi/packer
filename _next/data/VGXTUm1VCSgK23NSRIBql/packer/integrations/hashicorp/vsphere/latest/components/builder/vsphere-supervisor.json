It uses the vSphere API to build on a remote esx instance.\n  This allows you to build vms even if you do not have SSH access to your vSphere cluster.\n\n- [vsphere-supervisor](/packer/integrations/hashicorp/vsphere/latest/components/builder/vsphere-supervisor) - This builder deploys a\n  vm to a vSphere Supervisor cluster, using the VM-Service API. This allows you to build\n  vms without spec yaml files and configure them after using the Packer provisioners.\n\n#### Post-Processors\n- [vsphere](/packer/integrations/hashicorp/vsphere/latest/components/post-processor/vsphere) - The Packer vSphere post-processor takes an artifact \n  and uploads it to a vSphere endpoint.\n\n- [vsphere-template](/packer/integrations/hashicorp/vsphere/latest/components/post-processor/vsphere-template) - The Packer vSphere Template post-processor takes an \n  artifact from the vmware-iso builder, built on an ESXi host (i.e. remote) or an artifact from the \n  [vSphere](/packer/integrations/hashicorp/vsphere/latest/components/post-processor/vsphere) post-processor, marks the VM as a template, and leaves it in the path of \n  your choice.\n","created_at":"2023-08-03T20:13:42.307Z","updated_at":"2023-08-29T15:25:40.929Z","components":[{"id":"20eecdf6-c43a-4498-bca4-2a6dded90a4a","integration_release_id":"7cb3f2c5-171c-4798-9182-9cc65e72bb9c","component_id":"36076511-3ced-4faf-addf-101fce0405ff","readme":"Type: `vsphere-supervisor`\nArtifact BuilderId: `vsphere.supervisor`\n\nThis builder deploys and publishes new VMs to a vSphere Supervisor cluster using VM Service.\nIf you are new to VM Service, please refer to [Deploying and Managing Virtual Machines in vSphere with Tanzu\n](https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-vSphere/7.0/vmware-vsphere-with-tanzu/GUID-F81E3535-C275-4DDE-B35F-CE759EA3B4A0.html) for more information.\n\n- It uses a kubeconfig file to connect to the vSphere Supervisor cluster.\n- It uses the [VM-Operator API](https://vm-operator.readthedocs.io/en/latest/concepts/) to deploy and configure the source VM.\n- It uses the Packer provisioners to customize the VM after establishing a successful connection.\n- It publishes the customized VM as a new VM image to the designated content library in vSphere.\n- The builder supports versions following the VMware Product Lifecycle Matrix\n  from General Availability to End of General Support. Builds on versions that\n  are end of support may work, but configuration options may throw errors if\n  they do not exist in the vSphere API for those versions.\n\n## Examples\n\nExample Packer template:\n\n**HCL2**\n\n```hcl\nsource \"vsphere-supervisor\" \"example-vm\" {\n  image_name = \"<Image name of the source VM, e.g. 'ubuntu-impish-21.10-cloudimg'>\"\n  class_name = \"<VM class that describes the virtual hardware settings, e.g. 'best-effort-large'>\"\n  storage_class = \"<Storage class that provides the backing storage for volume, e.g. 'wcplocal-storage-profile'>\"\n  bootstrap_provider = \"<CloudInit, Sysprep, or vAppConfig to customize the guest OS>\"\n  bootstrap_data_file = \"<Path to the file containing the bootstrap data for guest OS customization>\"\n}\n\nbuild {\n  sources = [\"source.vsphere-supervisor.example-vm\"]\n}\n```\n\n**JSON**\n\n```json\n{\n  \"builders\": [\n    {\n      \"type\": \"vsphere-supervisor\",\n      \"image_name\": \"<Image name of the source VM, e.g. 'ubuntu-impish-21.10-cloudimg'>\",\n      \"class_name\": \"<VM class that describes the virtual hardware settings, e.g. 'best-effort-large'>\",\n      \"storage_class\": \"<Storage class that provides the backing storage for volume, e.g. 'wcplocal-storage-profile'>\",\n      \"bootstrap_provider\": \"<CloudInit, Sysprep, or vAppConfig to customize the guest OS>\",\n      \"bootstrap_data_file\": \"<Path to the file containing the bootstrap data for guest OS customization>\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\n\nRefer to the [examples/supervisor directory](https://github.com/hashicorp/packer-plugin-vsphere/tree/main/builder/vsphere/examples/supervisor) within the GitHub repository for more complete examples.\n\n## Configuration Reference\nThere are various configuration options available for each step in this builder.

This is a\n  mostly cosmetic option, since Packer will delete the temporary private\n  key from the host system regardless of whether this is set to true\n  (unless the user has set the `-debug` flag). Defaults to \"false\";\n  currently only works on guests with `sed` installed.\n\n- `ssh_key_exchange_algorithms` ([]string) - If set, Packer will override the value of key exchange (kex) algorithms\n  supported by default by Golang. Acceptable values include:\n  \"curve25519-sha256@libssh.org\", \"ecdh-sha2-nistp256\",\n  \"ecdh-sha2-nistp384\", \"ecdh-sha2-nistp521\",\n  \"diffie-hellman-group14-sha1\", and \"diffie-hellman-group1-sha1\".\n\n- `ssh_certificate_file` (string) - Path to user certificate used to authenticate with SSH.\n  The `~` can be used in path and will be expanded to the\n  home directory of current user.\n\n- `ssh_pty` (bool) - If `true`, a PTY will be requested for the SSH connection. This defaults\n  to `false`.\n\n- `ssh_timeout` (duration string | ex: \"1h5m2s\") - The time to wait for SSH to become available. Packer uses this to\n  determine when the machine has booted so this is usually quite long.\n  Example value: `10m`.\n  This defaults to `5m`, unless `ssh_handshake_attempts` is set.\n\n- `ssh_disable_agent_forwarding` (bool) - If true, SSH agent forwarding will be disabled. Defaults to `false`.\n\n- `ssh_handshake_attempts` (int) - The number of handshakes to attempt with SSH once it can connect.\n  This defaults to `10`, unless a `ssh_timeout` is set.\n\n- `ssh_bastion_host` (string) - A bastion host to use for the actual SSH connection.\n\n- `ssh_bastion_port` (int) - The port of the bastion host.

The possible values are 'dsa',\n  'ecdsa', 'ed25519', or 'rsa'.\n  \n  NOTE: DSA is deprecated and no longer recognized as secure, please\n  consider other alternatives like RSA or ED25519.\n\n- `temporary_key_pair_bits` (int) - Specifies the number of bits in the key to create. For RSA keys, the\n  minimum size is 1024 bits and the default is 4096 bits. Generally, 3072\n  bits is considered sufficient. DSA keys must be exactly 1024 bits as\n  specified by FIPS 186-2. For ECDSA keys, bits determines the key length\n  by selecting from one of three elliptic curve sizes: 256, 384 or 521\n  bits. Attempting to use bit lengths other than these three values for\n  ECDSA keys will fail. Ed25519 keys have a fixed length and bits will be\n  ignored.\n  \n  NOTE: DSA is deprecated and no longer recognized as secure as specified\n  by FIPS 186-5, please consider other alternatives like RSA or ED25519.\n\n<!-- End of code generated from the comments of the SSHTemporaryKeyPair struct in communicator/config.go; -->\n\n\n<!-- Code generated from the comments of the WinRM struct in communicator/config.go; DO NOT EDIT MANUALLY -->\n\n- `winrm_username` (string) - The username to use to connect to WinRM.\n\n- `winrm_password` (string) - The password to use to connect to WinRM.\n\n- `winrm_host` (string) - The address for WinRM to connect to.\n  \n  NOTE: If using an Amazon EBS builder, you can specify the interface\n  WinRM connects to via\n  [`ssh_interface`](/packer/integrations/hashicorp/amazon/latest/components/builder/ebs#ssh_interface)\n\n- `winrm_no_proxy` (bool) - Setting this to `true` adds the remote\n  `host:port` to the `NO_PROXY` environment variable. This has the effect of\n  bypassing any configured proxies when connecting to the remote host.\n  Default to `false`.\n\n- `winrm_port` (int) - The WinRM port to connect to.

They are\nsegmented below into two categories: required and optional parameters. Within\neach category, the available configuration keys are alphabetized.\n\nRequired:\n\n- `cluster` (string) - The vSphere cluster or ESXi host to upload the VM. This can be\n  either the name of the vSphere cluster or the FQDN/IP address of an ESXi host.\n\n- `datacenter` (string) - The name of the datacenter within the vSphere environemnt\n   to add the VM.\n\n- `datastore` (string) - The name of the datastore to place the VM. This is\n  _not required_ if `resource_pool` is specified.\n\n- `host` (string) - The vSphere endpoint that will be contacted to perform\n  the VM upload.\n\n- `password` (string) - The password to use to authenticate to the endpoint.\n\n- `username` (string) - The username to use to authenticate to the endpoint.\n\n- `vm_name` (string) - The name of the VM after upload.\n\nOptional:\n\n- `esxi_host` (string) - Target ESXi host. Used to assign specific ESXi\n  host to upload the resulting VM, when a vCenter Server is used as\n  `host`. Can be either an FQDN (e.g., \"esxi-01.example.com\", requires proper DNS\n  setup and/or correct DNS search domain setting) or an IPv4 address.\n\n- `disk_mode` (string) - Target disk format. See `ovftool` manual for\n  available options. Default: `thick`.\n\n- `insecure` (boolean) - Whether or not the connection can be done\n  over an insecure connection. Default: `false`\n\n- `keep_input_artifact` (boolean) - When `true`, preserve the local VM files,\n  even after importing them to the vSphere endpoint. Default: `false`.\n\n- `resource_pool` (string) - The resource pool in which to upload the VM.\n\n- `vm_folder` (string) - The folder within the datastore to place the VM.\n\n- `vm_network` (string) - The name of the network in which to place the VM.\n\n- `overwrite` (boolean) - If `true`, force the system to overwrite the\n  existing files instead create new ones. Default: `false`\n\n- `hardware_version` (string) - The virtual hardware version that the VM\n  should be deployed with. Use when deploying to vSphere / ESXi host whose version\n  is different than the the one used to create the artifact. See\n  [VMware KB 1003746](https://kb.vmware.com/s/article/1003746) for more information \n  on the virtual hardware versions supported by each vSphere / ESXi version.\n\n- `options` (array of strings) - Custom options to add in `ovftool`. See\n  `ovftool --help` to list all the options\n\n# Example\n\nThe following is an example of the vSphere post-processor being used in\nconjunction with the null builder to upload a vmx to a vSphere cluster.\n\nYou can also use this post-processor with the vmx artifact from a build.\n\n**HCL2**\n\n```hcl\nsource \"null\" \"example\" {\n    communicator = \"none\"\n}\n\nbuild {\n    sources = [\n        \"source.null.example\"\n    ]\n\n    post-processors {\n      post-processor \"vsphere\"{\n          vm_name             = \"packer\"\n          host                = \"vcenter.example.com\"\n          username            = \"administrator@vsphere.local\"\n          password            = \"VMw@re1!\"\n          datacenter          = \"dc-01\"   \n          cluster             = \"cluster-01\"\n          datastore           = \"datastore-01\"\n          vm_network          = \"VM Network\"\n          keep_input_artifact = true\n      }\n    }\n}\n```\n\n**JSON**\n\n```json\n{\n  \"builders\": [\n    {\n      \"type\": \"null\",\n      \"communicator\": \"none\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"post-processors\": [\n    [\n      {\n        \"type\": \"vsphere\",\n        \"vm_name\": \"packer\",\n        \"host\": \"vcenter.example.com\",\n        \"username\": \"administrator@vsphere.local\",\n        \"password\": \"VMw@re1!\",\n        \"datacenter\": \"dc-01\",\n        \"cluster\": \"cluster-01\",\n        \"datastore\": \"datastore-01\",\n        \"vm_network\": \"VM Network\",\n        \"keep_input_artifact\": true,\n      }\n    ]\n  ]\n}\n```\n\n\n# Privileges\n\nThe post-processor uses `ovftool` and therefore needs the same privileges\nas `ovftool`. Rather than giving full administrator access, you can create a role\nto give the post-processor the permissions necessary to run. Below is an example\nrole. Please note that this is a user-supplied list so there may be a few\nextraneous permissions that are not strictly required.\n\nFor vSphere the role needs the following privileges:\n\n    Datastore.AllocateSpace\n    Host.Config.AdvancedConfig\n    Host.Config.NetService\n    Host.Config.Network\n    Network.Assign\n    System.Anonymous\n    System.Read\n    System.View\n    VApp.Import\n    VirtualMachine.Config.AddNewDisk\n    VirtualMachine.Config.AdvancedConfig\n    VirtualMachine.Inventory.Delete\n\nAnd this role must be authorized on the:\n\n    Cluster of the host\n    The destination folder (not on Datastore, on the vSphere logical view)\n    The network to be assigned\n    The destination datastore.\n","created_at":"2023-08-03T20:13:45.534Z","updated_at":"2023-08-03T20:13:45.534Z","name":"vSphere","slug":"vsphere","component":{"id":"73965f1c-ad56-4f38-a31b-dc17d08c0ba6","slug":"post-processor","name":"Post-Processor","plural_name":"Post-Processors","product_id":"4c2b00c6-7cc1-4e4c-b596-4ab57e319f21","created_at":"2022-11-09T22:56:31.157Z","updated_at":"2023-07-26T17:26:54.831Z"},"variable_groups":[]},{"id":"d4331b0f-1efc-48c0-9beb-f8f3c888fbf0","integration_release_id":"7cb3f2c5-171c-4798-9182-9cc65e72bb9c","component_id":"73965f1c-ad56-4f38-a31b-dc17d08c0ba6","readme":"Type: `vsphere-template`\nArtifact BuilderId: `packer.post-processor.vsphere`\n\nThe Packer vSphere Template post-processor takes an artifact from the\n`vmware-iso` builder, built on ESXi (i.e. remote) or an artifact from the\n[vSphere](/packer/integrations/hashicorp/vsphere/latest/components/post-processor/vsphere) post-processor, marks the VM as a\ntemplate, and places it in the path of your choice.\n\n## Configuration\n\nThere are many configuration options available for the post-processor. They are\nprovided below in two categories: required and optional parameters.\n\nRequired:\n\n- `host` (string) - The vSphere endpoint that contains the VM built by the\n  `vmware-iso` builder.\n\n- `password` (string) - Password to use to authenticate to the vSphere\n  endpoint.\n\n- `username` (string) - The username to use to authenticate to the vSphere\n  endpoint.\n\nOptional:\n\n- `datacenter` (string) - If you have more than one, you will need to specify\n  which one the ESXi host used.\n\n- `folder` (string) - Target path where the template will be created.\n\n- `insecure` (boolean) - If `true`, skips the verification of the server\n  certificate. Default is `false`.\n\n- `keep_input_artifact` (boolean) - Unlike most post-processors, this option\n  has no effect for `vsphere-template`. This is because in order for a template\n  to work, you can't delete the vm that you generate the template from. The\n  vSphere Template post-processor will therefore always preserve the original\n  VM.\n\n- `snapshot_enable` (boolean) - Create a snapshot before marking as a\n  template. Default is `false`.\n\n- `snapshot_name` (string) - Name for the snapshot. Required when\n  `snapshot_enable` is `true`.\n\n- `snapshot_description` (string) - Description for the snapshot. Required\n  when `snapshot_enable` is `true`.\n\n- `reregister_vm` (boolean) - Use the method of unregister VM and reregister\n  as a template, rather than using the `markAsTemplate` method.\n\n  NOTE: If you are getting permission denied errors when trying to mark as a\n  template, but it works fine in the vSphere UI, try setting this to `false`.\n  Default is `true`.\n\n## Example\n\nAn example is shown below, showing only the post-processor configuration:\n\n**HCL2**\n\n```hcl\nsource \"null\" \"example\" {\n    communicator = \"none\"\n}\n\nbuild {\n    sources = [\n        \"source.null.example\"\n    ]\n\n    post-processors {\n      post-processor \"vsphere-template\"{\n          host                = \"vcenter.example.com\"\n          insecure            = false\n          username            = \"administrator@vsphere.local\"\n          password            = \"VMw@re1!\"\n          datacenter          = \"dc-01\"   \n          folder              = \"/templates/os/distro\"\n      }\n    }\n}\n```\n\n\n**JSON**\n\n```json\n{\n  \"builders\": [\n    {\n      \"type\": \"null\",\n      \"communicator\": \"none\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"post-processors\": [\n    [\n      {\n        \"type\": \"vsphere-template\",\n        \"host\": \"vcenter.example.com\",\n        \"insecure\": true,\n        \"username\": \"administrator@vsphere.local\",\n        \"password\": \"VMw@re1!\",\n        \"datacenter\": \"dc-01\",\n        \"folder\": \"/templates/os/distro\"\n      }\n    ]\n  ]\n}\n```\n\n\n## Using the vSphere Template with local builders\n\nOnce the [vSphere](/packer/integrations/hashicorp/vsphere/latest/components/post-processor/vsphere) post-processor takes an\nartifact from the builder and uploads it to a vSphere endpoint, you may want\nthe VM to be marked as a template. Packer can do this for you automatically\nusing a sequence definition (a collection of post-processors that are treated\nas as single pipeline, see [Post-Processors](/packer/docs/templates/legacy_json_templates/post-processors)\nfor more information):\n\n**HCL2**\n\n```hcl\nbuild {\n    sources = [\n        \"source.null.example\"\n    ]\n\n  post-processors {\n    post-processor \"vsphere\" {\n      # ...\n    }\n\n    post-processor \"vsphere-template\" {\n      # ...\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n\n**JSON**\n\n```json\n{\n  \"builders\": [\n    {\n      \"type\": \"null\",\n      \"communicator\": \"none\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"post-processors\": [\n    [\n      {\n        \"type\": \"vsphere\",\n         ...\n      },\n      {\n        \"type\": \"vsphere-template\",\n         ...\n      }\n    ],\n    {\n      \"type\": \"...\",\n      ...\n    }\n  ]\n}\n\n\n```\n\n\nIn the example above, the result of each builder is passed through the defined\nsequence of post-processors starting with the `vsphere` post-processor which\nwill upload the artifact to a vSphere endpoint. The resulting artifact is then\npassed on to the `vsphere-template` post-processor which handles marking a VM\nas a template. In JSON, note that the `vsphere` and `vsphere-template`\npost-processors can be paired together in their own array.\n\n## Permissions\n\nThe vSphere post processor needs several privileges to be able to mark the\nvm as a template. Rather than giving full administrator access, you can create\na role to give the post-processor the privileges necessary to run. Here is an\nexample role that will work. Please note that this is a user-supplied list so\nthere may be a few extraneous privilegess that are not strictly required.\n\nFor vSphere, the role needs the following privileges:\n\n    `Datastore.AllocateSpace`\n    `Host.Config.AdvancedConfig`\n    `Host.Config.NetService`\n    `Host.Config.Network`\n    `Network.Assign`\n    `System.Anonymous`\n    `System.Read`\n    `System.View`\n    `VApp.Import`\n    `VirtualMachine.Config.AddNewDisk`\n    `VirtualMachine.Config.AdvancedConfig`\n    `VirtualMachine.Inventory.Delete`\n\nand either (if `reregister_vm` is `false`):\n\n    `VirtualMachine.Provisioning.MarkAsTemplate`\n\nor (if `reregister_vm` is `true` or unset):\n\n    `VirtualMachine.Inventory.Register`\n    `VirtualMachine.Inventory.Unregister`\n\nThe role must be authorized on the:\n\n    `Cluster of the host`\n    `The destination folder`\n    `The destination datastore`\n    `The network to be assigned`\n\n# Troubleshooting\n\nSome users have reported that vSphere templates created from local vSphere builds\nget their boot order reset to cdrom only instead of the original boot order\ndefined by the template. If this issue affects you, the solution is to set\n`\"bios.hddOrder\": \"scsi0:0\"` in your builder's `vmx_data`.\n\nPacker doesn't automatically do this for you because it causes strange upload\nbehavior in certain versions of `ovftool`.\n","created_at":"2023-08-03T20:13:45.865Z","updated_at":"2023-08-29T15:25:42.771Z","name":"vSphere Template","slug":"vsphere-template","component":{"id":"73965f1c-ad56-4f38-a31b-dc17d08c0ba6","slug":"post-processor","name":"Post-Processor","plural_name":"Post-Processors","product_id":"4c2b00c6-7cc1-4e4c-b596-4ab57e319f21","created_at":"2022-11-09T22:56:31.157Z","updated_at":"2023-07-26T17:26:54.831Z"},"variable_groups":[]},{"id":"eb70f2b7-b829-4c8d-bedc-6de10bb4e814","integration_release_id":"7cb3f2c5-171c-4798-9182-9cc65e72bb9c","component_id":"36076511-3ced-4faf-addf-101fce0405ff","readme":"Type: `vsphere-clone`\nArtifact BuilderId: `jetbrains.vsphere`\n\nThis builder clones VMs from existing templates.\n\n- VMware Player is not required.\n- It uses the official vCenter Server API, and does not require ESXi host [modification](/packer/integrations/hashicorp/vsphere/latest/components/builder/vsphere-iso#building-on-a-remote-vsphere-hypervisor)\n- The builder supports versions following the VMware Product Lifecycle Matrix\n  from General Availability to End of General Support.

This command is typed after boot_wait, which gives the virtual\nmachine some time to actually load.\n\nThe boot_command is an array of strings. The strings are all typed in\nsequence. It is an array only to improve readability within the template.\n\nThere are a set of special keys available. If these are in your boot\ncommand, they will be replaced by the proper key:\n\n-   `<bs>` - Backspace\n\n-   `<del>` - Delete\n\n-   `<enter> <return>` - Simulates an actual \"enter\" or \"return\" keypress.\n\n-   `<esc>` - Simulates pressing the escape key.\n\n-   `<tab>` - Simulates pressing the tab key.\n\n-   `<f1> - <f12>` - Simulates pressing a function key.\n\n-   `<up> <down> <left> <right>` - Simulates pressing an arrow key.\n\n-   `<spacebar>` - Simulates pressing the spacebar.\n\n-   `<insert>` - Simulates pressing the insert key.\n\n-   `<home> <end>` - Simulates pressing the home and end keys.\n\n  - `<pageUp> <pageDown>` - Simulates pressing the page up and page down\n    keys.\n\n-   `<menu>` - Simulates pressing the Menu key.\n\n-   `<leftAlt> <rightAlt>` - Simulates pressing the alt key.\n\n-   `<leftCtrl> <rightCtrl>` - Simulates pressing the ctrl key.\n\n-   `<leftShift> <rightShift>` - Simulates pressing the shift key.\n\n-   `<leftSuper> <rightSuper>` - Simulates pressing the ⌘ or Windows key.\n\n  - `<wait> <wait5> <wait10>` - Adds a 1, 5 or 10 second pause before\n    sending any additional keys. This is useful if you have to generally\n    wait for the UI to update before typing more.\n\n  - `<waitXX>` - Add an arbitrary pause before sending any additional keys.\n    The format of `XX` is a sequence of positive decimal numbers, each with\n    optional fraction and a unit suffix, such as `300ms`, `1.5h` or `2h45m`.\n    Valid time units are `ns`, `us` (or `µs`), `ms`, `s`, `m`, `h`. For\n    example `<wait10m>` or `<wait1m20s>`.\n\n  - `<XXXOn> <XXXOff>` - Any printable keyboard character, and of these\n    \"special\" expressions, with the exception of the `<wait>` types, can\n    also be toggled on or off. For example, to simulate ctrl+c, use\n    `<leftCtrlOn>c<leftCtrlOff>`. Be sure to release them, otherwise they\n    will be held down until the machine reboots. To hold the `c` key down,\n    you would use `<cOn>`. Likewise, `<cOff>` to release.\n\n  - `{{ .HTTPIP }} {{ .HTTPPort }}` - The IP and port, respectively of an\n    HTTP server that is started serving the directory specified by the\n    `http_directory` configuration parameter. If `http_directory` isn't\n    specified, these will be blank!\n\n-   `{{ .Name }}` - The name of the VM.\n\nExample boot command. This is actually a working boot command used to start an\nCentOS 6.4 installer:\n\nIn JSON:\n\n```json\n\"boot_command\": [\n\n\t   \"<tab><wait>\",\n\t   \" ks=http://{{ .HTTPIP }}:{{ .HTTPPort }}/centos6-ks.cfg<enter>\"\n\t]\n\n```\n\nIn HCL2:\n\n```hcl\nboot_command = [\n\n\t   \"<tab><wait>\",\n\t   \" ks=http://{{ .HTTPIP }}:{{ .HTTPPort }}/centos6-ks.cfg<enter>\"\n\t]\n\n```\n\nThe example shown below is a working boot command used to start an Ubuntu\n12.04 installer:\n\nIn JSON:\n\n```json\n\"boot_command\": [\n\n\t\"<esc><esc><enter><wait>\",\n\t\"/install/vmlinuz noapic \",\n\t\"preseed/url=http://{{ .HTTPIP }}:{{ .HTTPPort }}/preseed.cfg \",\n\t\"debian-installer=en_US auto locale=en_US kbd-chooser/method=us \",\n\t\"hostname={{ .Name }} \",\n\t\"fb=false debconf/frontend=noninteractive \",\n\t\"keyboard-configuration/modelcode=SKIP keyboard-configuration/layout=USA \",\n\t\"keyboard-configuration/variant=USA console-setup/ask_detect=false \",\n\t\"initrd=/install/initrd.gz -- <enter>\"\n\n]\n```\n\nIn HCL2:\n\n```hcl\nboot_command = [\n\n\t\"<esc><esc><enter><wait>\",\n\t\"/install/vmlinuz noapic \",\n\t\"preseed/url=http://{{ .HTTPIP }}:{{ .HTTPPort }}/preseed.cfg \",\n\t\"debian-installer=en_US auto locale=en_US kbd-chooser/method=us \",\n\t\"hostname={{ .Name }} \",\n\t\"fb=false debconf/frontend=noninteractive \",\n\t\"keyboard-configuration/modelcode=SKIP keyboard-configuration/layout=USA \",\n\t\"keyboard-configuration/variant=USA console-setup/ask_detect=false \",\n\t\"initrd=/install/initrd.gz -- <enter>\"\n\n]\n```\n\nFor more examples of various boot commands, see the sample projects from our\n[community templates page](https://packer.io/community-tools#templates).\n\n<!-- End of code generated from the comments of the BootConfig struct in bootcommand/config.go; -->\n\n\n#### Optional:\n\n<!-- Code generated from the comments of the BootConfig struct in bootcommand/config.go; DO NOT EDIT MANUALLY -->\n\n- `boot_keygroup_interval` (duration string | ex: \"1h5m2s\") - Time to wait after sending a group of key pressses. The value of this\n  should be a duration. Examples are `5s` and `1m30s` which will cause\n  Packer to wait five seconds and one minute 30 seconds, respectively. If\n  this isn't specified, a sensible default value is picked depending on\n  the builder type.\n\n- `boot_wait` (duration string | ex: \"1h5m2s\") - The time to wait after booting the initial virtual machine before typing\n  the `boot_command`. The value of this should be a duration. Examples are\n  `5s` and `1m30s` which will cause Packer to wait five seconds and one\n  minute 30 seconds, respectively. If this isn't specified, the default is\n  `10s` or 10 seconds. To set boot_wait to 0s, use a negative number, such\n  as \"-1s\"\n\n- `boot_command` ([]string) - This is an array of commands to type when the virtual machine is first\n  booted. The goal of these commands should be to type just enough to\n  initialize the operating system installer. Special keys can be typed as\n  well, and are covered in the section below on the boot command. If this\n  is not specified, it is assumed the installer will start itself.\n\n<!-- End of code generated from the comments of the BootConfig struct in bootcommand/config.go; -->\n\n\n<!-- Code generated from the comments of the BootConfig struct in builder/vsphere/common/step_boot_command.go; DO NOT EDIT MANUALLY -->\n\n- `http_ip` (string) - The IP address to use for the HTTP server started to serve the `http_directory`.\n  If unset, Packer will automatically discover and assign an IP.\n\n<!-- End of code generated from the comments of the BootConfig struct in builder/vsphere/common/step_boot_command.go; -->\n\n\n### Http directory configuration\n\n<!-- Code generated from the comments of the HTTPConfig struct in multistep/commonsteps/http_config.go; DO NOT EDIT MANUALLY -->\n\nPacker will create an http server serving `http_directory` when it is set, a\nrandom free port will be selected and the architecture of the directory\nreferenced will be available in your builder.\n\nExample usage from a builder:\n\n```\nwget http://{{ .HTTPIP }}:{{ .HTTPPort }}/foo/bar/preseed.cfg\n```\n\n<!-- End of code generated from the comments of the HTTPConfig struct in multistep/commonsteps/http_config.go; -->\n\n\n#### Optional:\n\n<!-- Code generated from the comments of the HTTPConfig struct in multistep/commonsteps/http_config.go; DO NOT EDIT MANUALLY -->\n\n- `http_directory` (string) - Path to a directory to serve using an HTTP server. The files in this\n  directory will be available over HTTP that will be requestable from the\n  virtual machine. This is useful for hosting kickstart files and so on.\n  By default this is an empty string, which means no HTTP server will be\n  started. The address and port of the HTTP server will be available as\n  variables in `boot_command`. This is covered in more detail below.\n\n- `http_content` (map[string]string) - Key/Values to serve using an HTTP server. `http_content` works like and\n  conflicts with `http_directory`. The keys represent the paths and the\n  values contents, the keys must start with a slash, ex: `/path/to/file`.\n  `http_content` is useful for hosting kickstart files and so on. By\n  default this is empty, which means no HTTP server will be started. The\n  address and port of the HTTP server will be available as variables in\n  `boot_command`. This is covered in more detail below.\n  Example:\n  ```hcl\n    http_content = {\n      \"/a/b\"     = file(\"http/b\")\n      \"/foo/bar\" = templatefile(\"${path.root}/preseed.cfg\", { packages = [\"nginx\"] })\n    }\n  ```\n\n- `http_port_min` (int) - These are the minimum and maximum port to use for the HTTP server\n  started to serve the `http_directory`. Because Packer often runs in\n  parallel, Packer will choose a randomly available port in this range to\n  run the HTTP server. If you want to force the HTTP server to be on one\n  port, make this minimum and maximum port the same. By default the values\n  are `8000` and `9000`, respectively.\n\n- `http_port_max` (int) - HTTP Port Max\n\n- `http_bind_address` (string) - This is the bind address for the HTTP server. Defaults to 0.0.0.0 so that\n  it will work with any network interface.\n\n<!-- End of code generated from the comments of the HTTPConfig struct in multistep/commonsteps/http_config.go; -->\n\n\n### Floppy configuration\n\n<!-- Code generated from the comments of the FloppyConfig struct in builder/vsphere/common/step_add_floppy.go; DO NOT EDIT MANUALLY -->\n\n- `floppy_img_path` (string) - Datastore path to a floppy image that will be mounted to the VM.\n  Example: `[datastore1] ISO/pvscsi-Windows8.flp`.\n\n- `floppy_files` ([]string) - List of local files to be mounted to the VM floppy drive. Can be used to\n  make Debian preseed or RHEL kickstart files available to the VM.\n\n- `floppy_dirs` ([]string) - List of directories to copy files from.\n\n- `floppy_content` (map[string]string) - Key/Values to add to the floppy disk. The keys represent the paths, and\n  the values contents. It can be used alongside `floppy_files` or\n  `floppy_dirs`, which is useful to add large files without loading them\n  into memory. If any paths are specified by both, the contents in\n  `floppy_content` will take precedence.\n  \n  Usage example (HCL):\n  \n  ```hcl\n  floppy_content = {\n    \"meta-data\" = jsonencode(local.instance_data)\n    \"user-data\" = templatefile(\"user-data\", { packages = [\"nginx\"] })\n  }\n  ```\n\n- `floppy_label` (string) - The label to use for the floppy disk that\n  is attached when the VM is booted. This is most useful for cloud-init,\n  Kickstart or other early initialization tools, which can benefit from labelled floppy disks.\n  By default, the floppy label will be 'packer'.\n\n<!-- End of code generated from the comments of the FloppyConfig struct in builder/vsphere/common/step_add_floppy.go; -->\n\n\n### Connection Configuration\n\n<!-- Code generated from the comments of the ConnectConfig struct in builder/vsphere/common/step_connect.go; DO NOT EDIT MANUALLY -->\n\n- `vcenter_server` (string) - vCenter Server hostname.\n\n- `username` (string) - vSphere username.\n\n- `password` (string) - vSphere password.\n\n- `insecure_connection` (bool) - Do not validate the vCenter Server TLS certificate.

Defaults to 1.\n\n- `vgpu_profile` (string) - vGPU profile for accelerated graphics. See [NVIDIA GRID vGPU documentation](https://docs.nvidia.com/grid/latest/grid-vgpu-user-guide/index.html#configure-vmware-vsphere-vm-with-vgpu)\n  for examples of profile names. Defaults to none.\n\n- `NestedHV` (bool) - Enable nested hardware virtualization for VM. Defaults to `false`.\n\n- `firmware` (string) - Set the Firmware for virtual machine. Supported values: `bios`, `efi` or `efi-secure`. Defaults to `bios`.\n\n- `force_bios_setup` (bool) - During the boot, force entry into the BIOS setup screen.

See the\n  [Working With Clusters And Hosts](#working-with-clusters-and-hosts)\n  section above for more details.\n\n- `host` (string) - ESXi host where target VM is created. A full path must be specified if\n  the host is in a folder. For example `folder/host`. See the\n  [Working With Clusters And Hosts](#working-with-clusters-and-hosts)\n  section above for more details.\n\n- `resource_pool` (string) - vSphere resource pool. If not set, it will look for the root resource\n  pool of the `host` or `cluster`. If a root resource is not found, it\n  will then look for a default resource pool.\n\n- `datastore` (string) - vSphere datastore. Required if `host` is a cluster, or if `host` has\n  multiple datastores.\n\n- `set_host_for_datastore_uploads` (bool) - Set this to true if packer should use the host for uploading files\n  to the datastore. Defaults to false.\n\n<!-- End of code generated from the comments of the LocationConfig struct in builder/vsphere/common/config_location.go; -->\n\n\n### Run Configuration\n\n<!-- Code generated from the comments of the RunConfig struct in builder/vsphere/common/step_run.go; DO NOT EDIT MANUALLY -->\n\n- `boot_order` (string) - Priority of boot devices. Defaults to `disk,cdrom`\n\n<!-- End of code generated from the comments of the RunConfig struct in builder/vsphere/common/step_run.go; -->\n\n\n### Shutdown Configuration\n\n<!-- Code generated from the comments of the ShutdownConfig struct in builder/vsphere/common/step_shutdown.go; DO NOT EDIT MANUALLY -->\n\n- `shutdown_command` (string) - Specify a VM guest shutdown command. This command will be executed using\n  the `communicator`. Otherwise, the VMware Tools are used to gracefully shutdown\n  the VM.\n\n- `shutdown_timeout` (duration string | ex: \"1h5m2s\") - Amount of time to wait for graceful VM shutdown.\n  Defaults to 5m or five minutes.\n  This will likely need to be modified if the `communicator` is 'none'.\n\n- `disable_shutdown` (bool) - Packer normally halts the virtual machine after all provisioners have\n  run when no `shutdown_command` is defined. If this is set to `true`, Packer\n  *will not* halt the virtual machine but will assume that you will send the stop\n  signal yourself through a preseed.cfg, a script or the final provisioner.\n  Packer will wait for a default of five minutes until the virtual machine is shutdown.\n  The timeout can be changed using `shutdown_timeout` option.\n\n<!-- End of code generated from the comments of the ShutdownConfig struct in builder/vsphere/common/step_shutdown.go; -->\n\n\n### Wait Configuration\n\n<!-- Code generated from the comments of the WaitIpConfig struct in builder/vsphere/common/step_wait_for_ip.go; DO NOT EDIT MANUALLY -->\n\n- `ip_wait_timeout` (duration string | ex: \"1h5m2s\") - Amount of time to wait for VM's IP, similar to 'ssh_timeout'.\n  Defaults to 30m (30 minutes). See the Golang\n  [ParseDuration](https://golang.org/pkg/time/#ParseDuration) documentation\n  for full details.\n\n- `ip_settle_timeout` (duration string | ex: \"1h5m2s\") - Amount of time to wait for VM's IP to settle down, sometimes VM may\n  report incorrect IP initially, then its recommended to set that\n  parameter to apx. 2 minutes. Examples 45s and 10m. Defaults to\n  5s(5 seconds). See the Golang\n  [ParseDuration](https://golang.org/pkg/time/#ParseDuration) documentation\n   for full details.\n\n- `ip_wait_address` (\\*string) - Set this to a CIDR address to cause the service to wait for an address that is contained in\n  this network range. Defaults to \"0.0.0.0/0\" for any ipv4 address. Examples include:\n  \n  * empty string (\"\") - remove all filters\n  * `0:0:0:0:0:0:0:0/0` - allow only ipv6 addresses\n  * `192.168.1.0/24` - only allow ipv4 addresses from 192.168.1.1 to 192.168.1.254\n\n<!-- End of code generated from the comments of the WaitIpConfig struct in builder/vsphere/common/step_wait_for_ip.go; -->\n\n\n### CDRom Configuration\n\n<!-- Code generated from the comments of the CDConfig struct in multistep/commonsteps/extra_iso_config.go; DO NOT EDIT MANUALLY -->\n\nAn iso (CD) containing custom files can be made available for your build.\n\nBy default, no extra CD will be attached. All files listed in this setting\nget placed into the root directory of the CD and the CD is attached as the\nsecond CD device.\n\nThis config exists to work around modern operating systems that have no\nway to mount floppy disks, which was our previous go-to for adding files at\nboot time.\n\n<!-- End of code generated from the comments of the CDConfig struct in multistep/commonsteps/extra_iso_config.go; -->\n\n\n#### Optional:\n\n<!-- Code generated from the comments of the CDConfig struct in multistep/commonsteps/extra_iso_config.go; DO NOT EDIT MANUALLY -->\n\n- `cd_files` ([]string) - A list of files to place onto a CD that is attached when the VM is\n  booted. This can include either files or directories; any directories\n  will be copied onto the CD recursively, preserving directory structure\n  hierarchy. Symlinks will have the link's target copied into the directory\n  tree on the CD where the symlink was. File globbing is allowed.\n  \n  Usage example (JSON):\n  \n  ```json\n  \"cd_files\": [\"./somedirectory/meta-data\", \"./somedirectory/user-data\"],\n  \"cd_label\": \"cidata\",\n  ```\n  \n  Usage example (HCL):\n  \n  ```hcl\n  cd_files = [\"./somedirectory/meta-data\", \"./somedirectory/user-data\"]\n  cd_label = \"cidata\"\n  ```\n  \n  The above will create a CD with two files, user-data and meta-data in the\n  CD root. This specific example is how you would create a CD that can be\n  used for an Ubuntu 20.04 autoinstall.\n  \n  Since globbing is also supported,\n  \n  ```hcl\n  cd_files = [\"./somedirectory/*\"]\n  cd_label = \"cidata\"\n  ```\n  \n  Would also be an acceptable way to define the above cd. The difference\n  between providing the directory with or without the glob is whether the\n  directory itself or its contents will be at the CD root.\n  \n  Use of this option assumes that you have a command line tool installed\n  that can handle the iso creation. Packer will use one of the following\n  tools:\n  \n    * xorriso\n    * mkisofs\n    * hdiutil (normally found in macOS)\n    * oscdimg (normally found in Windows as part of the Windows ADK)\n\n- `cd_content` (map[string]string) - Key/Values to add to the CD. The keys represent the paths, and the values\n  contents. It can be used alongside `cd_files`, which is useful to add large\n  files without loading them into memory. If any paths are specified by both,\n  the contents in `cd_content` will take precedence.\n  \n  Usage example (HCL):\n  \n  ```hcl\n  cd_files = [\"vendor-data\"]\n  cd_content = {\n    \"meta-data\" = jsonencode(local.instance_data)\n    \"user-data\" = templatefile(\"user-data\", { packages = [\"nginx\"] })\n  }\n  cd_label = \"cidata\"\n  ```\n\n- `cd_label` (string) - CD Label\n\n<!-- End of code generated from the comments of the CDConfig struct in multistep/commonsteps/extra_iso_config.go; -->\n\n\n<!-- Code generated from the comments of the CDRomConfig struct in builder/vsphere/common/step_add_cdrom.go; DO NOT EDIT MANUALLY -->\n\n- `cdrom_type` (string) - Which controller to use. Example: `sata`. Defaults to `ide`.\n\n- `iso_paths` ([]string) - List of Datastore or Content Library paths to ISO files that will be mounted to the VM.\n  Here's an HCL2 example:\n  ```hcl\n  iso_paths = [\n    \"[datastore1] ISO/ubuntu.iso\",\n    \"Packer Library Test/ubuntu-16.04.6-server-amd64/ubuntu-16.04.6-server-amd64.iso\"\n  ]\n  ```\n\n<!-- End of code generated from the comments of the CDRomConfig struct in builder/vsphere/common/step_add_cdrom.go; -->\n\n\n<!-- Code generated from the comments of the RemoveCDRomConfig struct in builder/vsphere/common/step_remove_cdrom.go; DO NOT EDIT MANUALLY -->\n\n- `remove_cdrom` (bool) - Remove CD-ROM devices from template. Defaults to `false`.\n\n<!-- End of code generated from the comments of the RemoveCDRomConfig struct in builder/vsphere/common/step_remove_cdrom.go; -->\n\n\n### Communicator configuration\n\n#### Optional common fields:\n\n<!-- Code generated from the comments of the Config struct in communicator/config.go; DO NOT EDIT MANUALLY -->\n\n- `communicator` (string) - Packer currently supports three kinds of communicators:\n  \n  -   `none` - No communicator will be used. If this is set, most\n      provisioners also can't be used.\n  \n  -   `ssh` - An SSH connection will be established to the machine. This\n      is usually the default.\n  \n  -   `winrm` - A WinRM connection will be established.\n  \n  In addition to the above, some builders have custom communicators they\n  can use. For example, the Docker builder has a \"docker\" communicator\n  that uses `docker exec` and `docker cp` to execute scripts and copy\n  files.\n\n- `pause_before_connecting` (duration string | ex: \"1h5m2s\") - We recommend that you enable SSH or WinRM as the very last step in your\n  guest's bootstrap script, but sometimes you may have a race condition\n  where you need Packer to wait before attempting to connect to your\n  guest.\n  \n  If you end up in this situation, you can use the template option\n  `pause_before_connecting`. By default, there is no pause. For example if\n  you set `pause_before_connecting` to `10m` Packer will check whether it\n  can connect, as normal. But once a connection attempt is successful, it\n  will disconnect and then wait 10 minutes before connecting to the guest\n  and beginning provisioning.\n\n<!-- End of code generated from the comments of the Config struct in communicator/config.go; -->\n\n\n#### Optional SSH fields:\n\n<!-- Code generated from the comments of the SSH struct in communicator/config.go; DO NOT EDIT MANUALLY -->\n\n- `ssh_host` (string) - The address to SSH to. This usually is automatically configured by the\n  builder.\n\n- `ssh_port` (int) - The port to connect to SSH. This defaults to `22`.\n\n- `ssh_username` (string) - The username to connect to SSH with. Required if using SSH.\n\n- `ssh_password` (string) - A plaintext password to use to authenticate with SSH.\n\n- `ssh_ciphers` ([]string) - This overrides the value of ciphers supported by default by Golang.\n  The default value is [\n    \"aes128-gcm@openssh.com\",\n    \"chacha20-poly1305@openssh.com\",\n    \"aes128-ctr\", \"aes192-ctr\", \"aes256-ctr\",\n  ]\n  \n  Valid options for ciphers include:\n  \"aes128-ctr\", \"aes192-ctr\", \"aes256-ctr\", \"aes128-gcm@openssh.com\",\n  \"chacha20-poly1305@openssh.com\",\n  \"arcfour256\", \"arcfour128\", \"arcfour\", \"aes128-cbc\", \"3des-cbc\",\n\n- `ssh_clear_authorized_keys` (bool) - If true, Packer will attempt to remove its temporary key from\n  `~/.ssh/authorized_keys` and `/root/.ssh/authorized_keys`. This is a\n  mostly cosmetic option, since Packer will delete the temporary private\n  key from the host system regardless of whether this is set to true\n  (unless the user has set the `-debug` flag). Defaults to \"false\";\n  currently only works on guests with `sed` installed.\n\n- `ssh_key_exchange_algorithms` ([]string) - If set, Packer will override the value of key exchange (kex) algorithms\n  supported by default by Golang. Acceptable values include:\n  \"curve25519-sha256@libssh.org\", \"ecdh-sha2-nistp256\",\n  \"ecdh-sha2-nistp384\", \"ecdh-sha2-nistp521\",\n  \"diffie-hellman-group14-sha1\", and \"diffie-hellman-group1-sha1\".\n\n- `ssh_certificate_file` (string) - Path to user certificate used to authenticate with SSH.\n  The `~` can be used in path and will be expanded to the\n  home directory of current user.\n\n- `ssh_pty` (bool) - If `true`, a PTY will be requested for the SSH connection. This defaults\n  to `false`.\n\n- `ssh_timeout` (duration string | ex: \"1h5m2s\") - The time to wait for SSH to become available. Packer uses this to\n  determine when the machine has booted so this is usually quite long.\n  Example value: `10m`.\n  This defaults to `5m`, unless `ssh_handshake_attempts` is set.\n\n- `ssh_disable_agent_forwarding` (bool) - If true, SSH agent forwarding will be disabled. Defaults to `false`.\n\n- `ssh_handshake_attempts` (int) - The number of handshakes to attempt with SSH once it can connect.\n  This defaults to `10`, unless a `ssh_timeout` is set.\n\n- `ssh_bastion_host` (string) - A bastion host to use for the actual SSH connection.\n\n- `ssh_bastion_port` (int) - The port of the bastion host. Defaults to `22`.\n\n- `ssh_bastion_agent_auth` (bool) - If `true`, the local SSH agent will be used to authenticate with the\n  bastion host. Defaults to `false`.\n\n- `ssh_bastion_username` (string) - The username to connect to the bastion host.\n\n- `ssh_bastion_password` (string) - The password to use to authenticate with the bastion host.\n\n- `ssh_bastion_interactive` (bool) - If `true`, the keyboard-interactive used to authenticate with bastion host.\n\n- `ssh_bastion_private_key_file` (string) - Path to a PEM encoded private key file to use to authenticate with the\n  bastion host. The `~` can be used in path and will be expanded to the\n  home directory of current user.\n\n- `ssh_bastion_certificate_file` (string) - Path to user certificate used to authenticate with bastion host.\n  The `~` can be used in path and will be expanded to the\n  home directory of current user.\n\n- `ssh_file_transfer_method` (string) - `scp` or `sftp` - How to transfer files, Secure copy (default) or SSH\n  File Transfer Protocol.\n  \n  **NOTE**: Guests using Windows with Win32-OpenSSH v9.1.0.0p1-Beta, scp\n  (the default protocol for copying data) returns a a non-zero error code since the MOTW\n  cannot be set, which cause any file transfer to fail. As a workaround you can override the transfer protocol\n  with SFTP instead `ssh_file_transfer_protocol = \"sftp\"`.\n\n- `ssh_proxy_host` (string) - A SOCKS proxy host to use for SSH connection\n\n- `ssh_proxy_port` (int) - A port of the SOCKS proxy. Defaults to `1080`.\n\n- `ssh_proxy_username` (string) - The optional username to authenticate with the proxy server.\n\n- `ssh_proxy_password` (string) - The optional password to use to authenticate with the proxy server.\n\n- `ssh_keep_alive_interval` (duration string | ex: \"1h5m2s\") - How often to send \"keep alive\" messages to the server. Set to a negative\n  value (`-1s`) to disable. Example value: `10s`. Defaults to `5s`.\n\n- `ssh_read_write_timeout` (duration string | ex: \"1h5m2s\") - The amount of time to wait for a remote command to end. This might be\n  useful if, for example, packer hangs on a connection after a reboot.\n  Example: `5m`. Disabled by default.\n\n- `ssh_remote_tunnels` ([]string) - \n\n- `ssh_local_tunnels` ([]string) - \n\n<!-- End of code generated from the comments of the SSH struct in communicator/config.go; -->\n\n\n<!-- Code generated from the comments of the SSHTemporaryKeyPair struct in communicator/config.go; DO NOT EDIT MANUALLY -->\n\n- `temporary_key_pair_type` (string) - `dsa` | `ecdsa` | `ed25519` | `rsa` ( the default )\n  \n  Specifies the type of key to create. The possible values are 'dsa',\n  'ecdsa', 'ed25519', or 'rsa'.\n  \n  NOTE: DSA is deprecated and no longer recognized as secure, please\n  consider other alternatives like RSA or ED25519.\n\n- `temporary_key_pair_bits` (int) - Specifies the number of bits in the key to create. For RSA keys, the\n  minimum size is 1024 bits and the default is 4096 bits. Generally, 3072\n  bits is considered sufficient. DSA keys must be exactly 1024 bits as\n  specified by FIPS 186-2. For ECDSA keys, bits determines the key length\n  by selecting from one of three elliptic curve sizes: 256, 384 or 521\n  bits. Attempting to use bit lengths other than these three values for\n  ECDSA keys will fail. Ed25519 keys have a fixed length and bits will be\n  ignored.\n  \n  NOTE: DSA is deprecated and no longer recognized as secure as specified\n  by FIPS 186-5, please consider other alternatives like RSA or ED25519.\n\n<!-- End of code generated from the comments of the SSHTemporaryKeyPair struct in communicator/config.go; -->\n\n\n- `ssh_keypair_name` (string) - If specified, this is the key that will be used for SSH with the\n  machine. The key must match a key pair name loaded up into the remote.\n  By default, this is blank, and Packer will generate a temporary keypair\n  unless [`ssh_password`](#ssh_password) is used.\n  [`ssh_private_key_file`](#ssh_private_key_file) or\n  [`ssh_agent_auth`](#ssh_agent_auth) must be specified when\n  [`ssh_keypair_name`](#ssh_keypair_name) is utilized.\n\n\n- `ssh_private_key_file` (string) - Path to a PEM encoded private key file to use to authenticate with SSH.\n  The `~` can be used in path and will be expanded to the home directory\n  of current user.\n\n\n- `ssh_agent_auth` (bool) - If true, the local SSH agent will be used to authenticate connections to\n  the source instance. No temporary keypair will be created, and the\n  values of [`ssh_password`](#ssh_password) and\n  [`ssh_private_key_file`](#ssh_private_key_file) will be ignored. The\n  environment variable `SSH_AUTH_SOCK` must be set for this option to work\n  properly.\n\n\n-> **NOTE:** Packer uses vApp Options to inject ssh public keys to the virtual machine.\nThe [temporary_key_pair_name](/packer/integrations/hashicorp/vsphere/latest/components/builder/vsphere-clone#temporary_key_pair_name) will only work\nif the template being cloned contains the vApp property `public-keys`.\nIf using [ssh_private_key_file](/packer/integrations/hashicorp/vsphere/latest/components/builder/vsphere-clone#ssh_private_key_file), provide\nthe public key via [configuration_parameters](/packer/integrations/hashicorp/vsphere/latest/components/builder/vsphere-clone#configuration_parameters) or\n[vApp Options Configuration](/packer/integrations/hashicorp/vsphere/latest/components/builder/vsphere-clone#vapp-options-configuration) whenever the `guestinto.userdata`\nis available.

This has the effect of\n  bypassing any configured proxies when connecting to the remote host.\n  Default to `false`.\n\n- `winrm_port` (int) - The WinRM port to connect to. This defaults to `5985` for plain\n  unencrypted connection and `5986` for SSL when `winrm_use_ssl` is set to\n  true.\n\n- `winrm_timeout` (duration string | ex: \"1h5m2s\") - The amount of time to wait for WinRM to become available. This defaults\n  to `30m` since setting up a Windows machine generally takes a long time.\n\n- `winrm_use_ssl` (bool) - If `true`, use HTTPS for WinRM.\n\n- `winrm_insecure` (bool) - If `true`, do not check server certificate chain and host name.\n\n- `winrm_use_ntlm` (bool) - If `true`, NTLMv2 authentication (with session security) will be used\n  for WinRM, rather than default (basic authentication), removing the\n  requirement for basic authentication to be enabled within the target\n  guest.

The path to the directory may be relative or\n  absolute. If relative, the path is relative to the working directory\n  packer is executed from. This directory must not exist or, if\n  created, must be empty prior to running the builder. By default this is\n  \"output-BUILDNAME\" where \"BUILDNAME\" is the name of the build.\n\n- `directory_permission` (os.FileMode) - The permissions to apply to the \"output_directory\", and to any parent\n  directories that get created for output_directory.

It\nstarts from an ISO file and creates new VMs from scratch.\n\n- VMware Player is not required.\n- It uses the official vCenter Server API, and does not require ESXi host [modification](/packer/integrations/hashicorp/vsphere/latest/components/builder/vsphere-iso#building-on-a-remote-vsphere-hypervisor)\n- The builder supports versions following the VMware Product Lifecycle Matrix\n  from General Availability to End of General Support. Builds on versions that\n  are end of support may work, but configuration options may throw errors if\n  they do not exist in the vSphere API for those versions.\n\n## Examples\n\nSee complete Ubuntu, Windows, and macOS templates in the [examples folder](https://github.com/hashicorp/packer-plugin-vsphere/tree/main/builder/vsphere/examples/).\n\n# Configuration Reference\n\nThere are many configuration options available for this builder. In addition to\nthe items listed here, you will want to look at the general configuration\nreferences for [HTTP](#http-directory-configuration),\n[Floppy](#floppy-configuration),\n[Boot](#boot-configuration),\n[Hardware](#hardware-configuration),\n[Output](#output-configuration),\n[Run](#run-configuration),\n[Shutdown](#shutdown-configuration),\n[Communicator](#communicator-configuration),\n[Export](#export-configuration),\nconfiguration references, which are\nnecessary for this build to succeed and can be found further down the page.\n\n<!-- Code generated from the comments of the Config struct in builder/vsphere/iso/config.go; DO NOT EDIT MANUALLY -->\n\n- `create_snapshot` (bool) - Create a snapshot when set to `true`, so the VM can be used as a base\n  for linked clones.

This command is typed after boot_wait, which gives the virtual\nmachine some time to actually load.\n\nThe boot_command is an array of strings. The strings are all typed in\nsequence. It is an array only to improve readability within the template.\n\nThere are a set of special keys available. If these are in your boot\ncommand, they will be replaced by the proper key:\n\n-   `<bs>` - Backspace\n\n-   `<del>` - Delete\n\n-   `<enter> <return>` - Simulates an actual \"enter\" or \"return\" keypress.\n\n-   `<esc>` - Simulates pressing the escape key.\n\n-   `<tab>` - Simulates pressing the tab key.\n\n-   `<f1> - <f12>` - Simulates pressing a function key.\n\n-   `<up> <down> <left> <right>` - Simulates pressing an arrow key.\n\n-   `<spacebar>` - Simulates pressing the spacebar.\n\n-   `<insert>` - Simulates pressing the insert key.\n\n-   `<home> <end>` - Simulates pressing the home and end keys.\n\n  - `<pageUp> <pageDown>` - Simulates pressing the page up and page down\n    keys.\n\n-   `<menu>` - Simulates pressing the Menu key.\n\n-   `<leftAlt> <rightAlt>` - Simulates pressing the alt key.\n\n-   `<leftCtrl> <rightCtrl>` - Simulates pressing the ctrl key.\n\n-   `<leftShift> <rightShift>` - Simulates pressing the shift key.\n\n-   `<leftSuper> <rightSuper>` - Simulates pressing the ⌘ or Windows key.\n\n  - `<wait> <wait5> <wait10>` - Adds a 1, 5 or 10 second pause before\n    sending any additional keys. This is useful if you have to generally\n    wait for the UI to update before typing more.\n\n  - `<waitXX>` - Add an arbitrary pause before sending any additional keys.\n    The format of `XX` is a sequence of positive decimal numbers, each with\n    optional fraction and a unit suffix, such as `300ms`, `1.5h` or `2h45m`.\n    Valid time units are `ns`, `us` (or `µs`), `ms`, `s`, `m`, `h`. For\n    example `<wait10m>` or `<wait1m20s>`.\n\n  - `<XXXOn> <XXXOff>` - Any printable keyboard character, and of these\n    \"special\" expressions, with the exception of the `<wait>` types, can\n    also be toggled on or off. For example, to simulate ctrl+c, use\n    `<leftCtrlOn>c<leftCtrlOff>`. Be sure to release them, otherwise they\n    will be held down until the machine reboots. To hold the `c` key down,\n    you would use `<cOn>`. Likewise, `<cOff>` to release.\n\n  - `{{ .HTTPIP }} {{ .HTTPPort }}` - The IP and port, respectively of an\n    HTTP server that is started serving the directory specified by the\n    `http_directory` configuration parameter. If `http_directory` isn't\n    specified, these will be blank!\n\n-   `{{ .Name }}` - The name of the VM.\n\nExample boot command. This is actually a working boot command used to start an\nCentOS 6.4 installer:\n\nIn JSON:\n\n```json\n\"boot_command\": [\n\n\t   \"<tab><wait>\",\n\t   \" ks=http://{{ .HTTPIP }}:{{ .HTTPPort }}/centos6-ks.cfg<enter>\"\n\t]\n\n```\n\nIn HCL2:\n\n```hcl\nboot_command = [\n\n\t   \"<tab><wait>\",\n\t   \" ks=http://{{ .HTTPIP }}:{{ .HTTPPort }}/centos6-ks.cfg<enter>\"\n\t]\n\n```\n\nThe example shown below is a working boot command used to start an Ubuntu\n12.04 installer:\n\nIn JSON:\n\n```json\n\"boot_command\": [\n\n\t\"<esc><esc><enter><wait>\",\n\t\"/install/vmlinuz noapic \",\n\t\"preseed/url=http://{{ .HTTPIP }}:{{ .HTTPPort }}/preseed.cfg \",\n\t\"debian-installer=en_US auto locale=en_US kbd-chooser/method=us \",\n\t\"hostname={{ .Name }} \",\n\t\"fb=false debconf/frontend=noninteractive \",\n\t\"keyboard-configuration/modelcode=SKIP keyboard-configuration/layout=USA \",\n\t\"keyboard-configuration/variant=USA console-setup/ask_detect=false \",\n\t\"initrd=/install/initrd.gz -- <enter>\"\n\n]\n```\n\nIn HCL2:\n\n```hcl\nboot_command = [\n\n\t\"<esc><esc><enter><wait>\",\n\t\"/install/vmlinuz noapic \",\n\t\"preseed/url=http://{{ .HTTPIP }}:{{ .HTTPPort }}/preseed.cfg \",\n\t\"debian-installer=en_US auto locale=en_US kbd-chooser/method=us \",\n\t\"hostname={{ .Name }} \",\n\t\"fb=false debconf/frontend=noninteractive \",\n\t\"keyboard-configuration/modelcode=SKIP keyboard-configuration/layout=USA \",\n\t\"keyboard-configuration/variant=USA console-setup/ask_detect=false \",\n\t\"initrd=/install/initrd.gz -- <enter>\"\n\n]\n```\n\nFor more examples of various boot commands, see the sample projects from our\n[community templates page](https://packer.io/community-tools#templates).\n\n<!-- End of code generated from the comments of the BootConfig struct in bootcommand/config.go; -->\n\n\nWe send each character to the VM with a default delay of 100ms between groups.\nThe delay alleviates possible issues with latency and CPU\ncontention. If you notice missing keys, you can tune this delay by specifying\n\"boot_keygroup_interval\" in your Packer template, for example:\n\n**JSON**\n\n```json\n{\n  \"builders\": [\n    {\n      \"type\": \"vsphere-iso\",\n      \"boot_keygroup_interval\": \"500ms\"\n      ...\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\n**HCL2**\n\n```hcl\nsource \"vsphere-iso\" \"example\" {\n    boot_keygroup_interval = \"500ms\"\n    # ...\n}\n```\n\n\n## Optional:\n\n<!-- Code generated from the comments of the BootConfig struct in bootcommand/config.go; DO NOT EDIT MANUALLY -->\n\n- `boot_keygroup_interval` (duration string | ex: \"1h5m2s\") - Time to wait after sending a group of key pressses. The value of this\n  should be a duration. Examples are `5s` and `1m30s` which will cause\n  Packer to wait five seconds and one minute 30 seconds, respectively. If\n  this isn't specified, a sensible default value is picked depending on\n  the builder type.\n\n- `boot_wait` (duration string | ex: \"1h5m2s\") - The time to wait after booting the initial virtual machine before typing\n  the `boot_command`. The value of this should be a duration. Examples are\n  `5s` and `1m30s` which will cause Packer to wait five seconds and one\n  minute 30 seconds, respectively. If this isn't specified, the default is\n  `10s` or 10 seconds. To set boot_wait to 0s, use a negative number, such\n  as \"-1s\"\n\n- `boot_command` ([]string) - This is an array of commands to type when the virtual machine is first\n  booted. The goal of these commands should be to type just enough to\n  initialize the operating system installer. Special keys can be typed as\n  well, and are covered in the section below on the boot command. If this\n  is not specified, it is assumed the installer will start itself.\n\n<!-- End of code generated from the comments of the BootConfig struct in bootcommand/config.go; -->\n\n\n<!-- Code generated from the comments of the BootConfig struct in builder/vsphere/common/step_boot_command.go; DO NOT EDIT MANUALLY -->\n\n- `http_ip` (string) - The IP address to use for the HTTP server started to serve the `http_directory`.\n  If unset, Packer will automatically discover and assign an IP.\n\n<!-- End of code generated from the comments of the BootConfig struct in builder/vsphere/common/step_boot_command.go; -->\n\n\n## Http directory configuration\n\n<!-- Code generated from the comments of the HTTPConfig struct in multistep/commonsteps/http_config.go; DO NOT EDIT MANUALLY -->\n\nPacker will create an http server serving `http_directory` when it is set, a\nrandom free port will be selected and the architecture of the directory\nreferenced will be available in your builder.\n\nExample usage from a builder:\n\n```\nwget http://{{ .HTTPIP }}:{{ .HTTPPort }}/foo/bar/preseed.cfg\n```\n\n<!-- End of code generated from the comments of the HTTPConfig struct in multistep/commonsteps/http_config.go; -->\n\n\n## Optional:\n\n<!-- Code generated from the comments of the HTTPConfig struct in multistep/commonsteps/http_config.go; DO NOT EDIT MANUALLY -->\n\n- `http_directory` (string) - Path to a directory to serve using an HTTP server. The files in this\n  directory will be available over HTTP that will be requestable from the\n  virtual machine. This is useful for hosting kickstart files and so on.\n  By default this is an empty string, which means no HTTP server will be\n  started. The address and port of the HTTP server will be available as\n  variables in `boot_command`. This is covered in more detail below.\n\n- `http_content` (map[string]string) - Key/Values to serve using an HTTP server. `http_content` works like and\n  conflicts with `http_directory`. The keys represent the paths and the\n  values contents, the keys must start with a slash, ex: `/path/to/file`.\n  `http_content` is useful for hosting kickstart files and so on. By\n  default this is empty, which means no HTTP server will be started. The\n  address and port of the HTTP server will be available as variables in\n  `boot_command`. This is covered in more detail below.\n  Example:\n  ```hcl\n    http_content = {\n      \"/a/b\"     = file(\"http/b\")\n      \"/foo/bar\" = templatefile(\"${path.root}/preseed.cfg\", { packages = [\"nginx\"] })\n    }\n  ```\n\n- `http_port_min` (int) - These are the minimum and maximum port to use for the HTTP server\n  started to serve the `http_directory`. Because Packer often runs in\n  parallel, Packer will choose a randomly available port in this range to\n  run the HTTP server. If you want to force the HTTP server to be on one\n  port, make this minimum and maximum port the same. By default the values\n  are `8000` and `9000`, respectively.\n\n- `http_port_max` (int) - HTTP Port Max\n\n- `http_bind_address` (string) - This is the bind address for the HTTP server. Defaults to 0.0.0.0 so that\n  it will work with any network interface.\n\n<!-- End of code generated from the comments of the HTTPConfig struct in multistep/commonsteps/http_config.go; -->\n\n\n## Floppy configuration\n\n<!-- Code generated from the comments of the FloppyConfig struct in builder/vsphere/common/step_add_floppy.go; DO NOT EDIT MANUALLY -->\n\n- `floppy_img_path` (string) - Datastore path to a floppy image that will be mounted to the VM.\n  Example: `[datastore1] ISO/pvscsi-Windows8.flp`.\n\n- `floppy_files` ([]string) - List of local files to be mounted to the VM floppy drive. Can be used to\n  make Debian preseed or RHEL kickstart files available to the VM.\n\n- `floppy_dirs` ([]string) - List of directories to copy files from.\n\n- `floppy_content` (map[string]string) - Key/Values to add to the floppy disk. The keys represent the paths, and\n  the values contents. It can be used alongside `floppy_files` or\n  `floppy_dirs`, which is useful to add large files without loading them\n  into memory. If any paths are specified by both, the contents in\n  `floppy_content` will take precedence.\n  \n  Usage example (HCL):\n  \n  ```hcl\n  floppy_content = {\n    \"meta-data\" = jsonencode(local.instance_data)\n    \"user-data\" = templatefile(\"user-data\", { packages = [\"nginx\"] })\n  }\n  ```\n\n- `floppy_label` (string) - The label to use for the floppy disk that\n  is attached when the VM is booted. This is most useful for cloud-init,\n  Kickstart or other early initialization tools, which can benefit from labelled floppy disks.\n  By default, the floppy label will be 'packer'.\n\n<!-- End of code generated from the comments of the FloppyConfig struct in builder/vsphere/common/step_add_floppy.go; -->\n\n\n## Connection Configuration\n\n<!-- Code generated from the comments of the ConnectConfig struct in builder/vsphere/common/step_connect.go; DO NOT EDIT MANUALLY -->\n\n- `vcenter_server` (string) - vCenter Server hostname.\n\n- `username` (string) - vSphere username.\n\n- `password` (string) - vSphere password.\n\n- `insecure_connection` (bool) - Do not validate the vCenter Server TLS certificate.

Otherwise, the VMware Tools are used to gracefully shutdown\n  the VM.\n\n- `shutdown_timeout` (duration string | ex: \"1h5m2s\") - Amount of time to wait for graceful VM shutdown.\n  Defaults to 5m or five minutes.\n  This will likely need to be modified if the `communicator` is 'none'.\n\n- `disable_shutdown` (bool) - Packer normally halts the virtual machine after all provisioners have\n  run when no `shutdown_command` is defined. If this is set to `true`, Packer\n  *will not* halt the virtual machine but will assume that you will send the stop\n  signal yourself through a preseed.cfg, a script or the final provisioner.\n  Packer will wait for a default of five minutes until the virtual machine is shutdown.\n  The timeout can be changed using `shutdown_timeout` option.\n\n<!-- End of code generated from the comments of the ShutdownConfig struct in builder/vsphere/common/step_shutdown.go; -->\n\n\n## Wait Configuration\n\n<!-- Code generated from the comments of the WaitIpConfig struct in builder/vsphere/common/step_wait_for_ip.go; DO NOT EDIT MANUALLY -->\n\n- `ip_wait_timeout` (duration string | ex: \"1h5m2s\") - Amount of time to wait for VM's IP, similar to 'ssh_timeout'.\n  Defaults to 30m (30 minutes). See the Golang\n  [ParseDuration](https://golang.org/pkg/time/#ParseDuration) documentation\n  for full details.\n\n- `ip_settle_timeout` (duration string | ex: \"1h5m2s\") - Amount of time to wait for VM's IP to settle down, sometimes VM may\n  report incorrect IP initially, then its recommended to set that\n  parameter to apx. 2 minutes.

Defaults to \"0.0.0.0/0\" for any ipv4 address. Examples include:\n  \n  * empty string (\"\") - remove all filters\n  * `0:0:0:0:0:0:0:0/0` - allow only ipv6 addresses\n  * `192.168.1.0/24` - only allow ipv4 addresses from 192.168.1.1 to 192.168.1.254\n\n<!-- End of code generated from the comments of the WaitIpConfig struct in builder/vsphere/common/step_wait_for_ip.go; -->\n\n\n## ISO Configuration\n\n<!-- Code generated from the comments of the ISOConfig struct in multistep/commonsteps/iso_config.go; DO NOT EDIT MANUALLY -->\n\nBy default, Packer will symlink, download or copy image files to the Packer\ncache into a \"`hash($iso_url+$iso_checksum).$iso_target_extension`\" file.\nPacker uses [hashicorp/go-getter](https://github.com/hashicorp/go-getter) in\nfile mode in order to perform a download.\n\ngo-getter supports the following protocols:\n\n* Local files\n* Git\n* Mercurial\n* HTTP\n* Amazon S3\n\nExamples:\ngo-getter can guess the checksum type based on `iso_checksum` length, and it is\nalso possible to specify the checksum type.\n\nIn JSON:\n\n```json\n\n\t\"iso_checksum\": \"946a6077af6f5f95a51f82fdc44051c7aa19f9cfc5f737954845a6050543d7c2\",\n\t\"iso_url\": \"ubuntu.org/.../ubuntu-14.04.1-server-amd64.iso\"\n\n```\n\n```json\n\n\t\"iso_checksum\": \"file:ubuntu.org/..../ubuntu-14.04.1-server-amd64.iso.sum\",\n\t\"iso_url\": \"ubuntu.org/.../ubuntu-14.04.1-server-amd64.iso\"\n\n```\n\n```json\n\n\t\"iso_checksum\": \"file://./shasums.txt\",\n\t\"iso_url\": \"ubuntu.org/.../ubuntu-14.04.1-server-amd64.iso\"\n\n```\n\n```json\n\n\t\"iso_checksum\": \"file:./shasums.txt\",\n\t\"iso_url\": \"ubuntu.org/.../ubuntu-14.04.1-server-amd64.iso\"\n\n```\n\nIn HCL2:\n\n```hcl\n\n\tiso_checksum = \"946a6077af6f5f95a51f82fdc44051c7aa19f9cfc5f737954845a6050543d7c2\"\n\tiso_url = \"ubuntu.org/.../ubuntu-14.04.1-server-amd64.iso\"\n\n```\n\n```hcl\n\n\tiso_checksum = \"file:ubuntu.org/..../ubuntu-14.04.1-server-amd64.iso.sum\"\n\tiso_url = \"ubuntu.org/.../ubuntu-14.04.1-server-amd64.iso\"\n\n```\n\n```hcl\n\n\tiso_checksum = \"file://./shasums.txt\"\n\tiso_url = \"ubuntu.org/.../ubuntu-14.04.1-server-amd64.iso\"\n\n```\n\n```hcl\n\n\tiso_checksum = \"file:./shasums.txt\",\n\tiso_url = \"ubuntu.org/.../ubuntu-14.04.1-server-amd64.iso\"\n\n```\n\n<!-- End of code generated from the comments of the ISOConfig struct in multistep/commonsteps/iso_config.go; -->\n\n\n## Required:\n\n<!-- Code generated from the comments of the ISOConfig struct in multistep/commonsteps/iso_config.go; DO NOT EDIT MANUALLY -->\n\n- `iso_checksum` (string) - The checksum for the ISO file or virtual hard drive file.

This can include either files or directories; any directories\n  will be copied onto the CD recursively, preserving directory structure\n  hierarchy. Symlinks will have the link's target copied into the directory\n  tree on the CD where the symlink was.

This specific example is how you would create a CD that can be\n  used for an Ubuntu 20.04 autoinstall.\n  \n  Since globbing is also supported,\n  \n  ```hcl\n  cd_files = [\"./somedirectory/*\"]\n  cd_label = \"cidata\"\n  ```\n  \n  Would also be an acceptable way to define the above cd. The difference\n  between providing the directory with or without the glob is whether the\n  directory itself or its contents will be at the CD root.\n  \n  Use of this option assumes that you have a command line tool installed\n  that can handle the iso creation. Packer will use one of the following\n  tools:\n  \n    * xorriso\n    * mkisofs\n    * hdiutil (normally found in macOS)\n    * oscdimg (normally found in Windows as part of the Windows ADK)\n\n- `cd_content` (map[string]string) - Key/Values to add to the CD. The keys represent the paths, and the values\n  contents. It can be used alongside `cd_files`, which is useful to add large\n  files without loading them into memory.

If this is set, most\n      provisioners also can't be used.\n  \n  -   `ssh` - An SSH connection will be established to the machine. This\n      is usually the default.\n  \n  -   `winrm` - A WinRM connection will be established.\n  \n  In addition to the above, some builders have custom communicators they\n  can use. For example, the Docker builder has a \"docker\" communicator\n  that uses `docker exec` and `docker cp` to execute scripts and copy\n  files.\n\n- `pause_before_connecting` (duration string | ex: \"1h5m2s\") - We recommend that you enable SSH or WinRM as the very last step in your\n  guest's bootstrap script, but sometimes you may have a race condition\n  where you need Packer to wait before attempting to connect to your\n  guest.\n  \n  If you end up in this situation, you can use the template option\n  `pause_before_connecting`. By default, there is no pause. For example if\n  you set `pause_before_connecting` to `10m` Packer will check whether it\n  can connect, as normal. But once a connection attempt is successful, it\n  will disconnect and then wait 10 minutes before connecting to the guest\n  and beginning provisioning.\n\n<!-- End of code generated from the comments of the Config struct in communicator/config.go; -->\n\n\n## Optional SSH fields:\n\n<!-- Code generated from the comments of the SSH struct in communicator/config.go; DO NOT EDIT MANUALLY -->\n\n- `ssh_host` (string) - The address to SSH to. This usually is automatically configured by the\n  builder.\n\n- `ssh_port` (int) - The port to connect to SSH. This defaults to `22`.\n\n- `ssh_username` (string) - The username to connect to SSH with. Required if using SSH.\n\n- `ssh_password` (string) - A plaintext password to use to authenticate with SSH.\n\n- `ssh_ciphers` ([]string) - This overrides the value of ciphers supported by default by Golang.\n  The default value is [\n    \"aes128-gcm@openssh.com\",\n    \"chacha20-poly1305@openssh.com\",\n    \"aes128-ctr\", \"aes192-ctr\", \"aes256-ctr\",\n  ]\n  \n  Valid options for ciphers include:\n  \"aes128-ctr\", \"aes192-ctr\", \"aes256-ctr\", \"aes128-gcm@openssh.com\",\n  \"chacha20-poly1305@openssh.com\",\n  \"arcfour256\", \"arcfour128\", \"arcfour\", \"aes128-cbc\", \"3des-cbc\",\n\n- `ssh_clear_authorized_keys` (bool) - If true, Packer will attempt to remove its temporary key from\n  `~/.ssh/authorized_keys` and `/root/.ssh/authorized_keys`. This is a\n  mostly cosmetic option, since Packer will delete the temporary private\n  key from the host system regardless of whether this is set to true\n  (unless the user has set the `-debug` flag). Defaults to \"false\";\n  currently only works on guests with `sed` installed.\n\n- `ssh_key_exchange_algorithms` ([]string) - If set, Packer will override the value of key exchange (kex) algorithms\n  supported by default by Golang. Acceptable values include:\n  \"curve25519-sha256@libssh.org\", \"ecdh-sha2-nistp256\",\n  \"ecdh-sha2-nistp384\", \"ecdh-sha2-nistp521\",\n  \"diffie-hellman-group14-sha1\", and \"diffie-hellman-group1-sha1\".\n\n- `ssh_certificate_file` (string) - Path to user certificate used to authenticate with SSH.\n  The `~` can be used in path and will be expanded to the\n  home directory of current user.\n\n- `ssh_pty` (bool) - If `true`, a PTY will be requested for the SSH connection. This defaults\n  to `false`.\n\n- `ssh_timeout` (duration string | ex: \"1h5m2s\") - The time to wait for SSH to become available. Packer uses this to\n  determine when the machine has booted so this is usually quite long.\n  Example value: `10m`.\n  This defaults to `5m`, unless `ssh_handshake_attempts` is set.\n\n- `ssh_disable_agent_forwarding` (bool) - If true, SSH agent forwarding will be disabled. Defaults to `false`.\n\n- `ssh_handshake_attempts` (int) - The number of handshakes to attempt with SSH once it can connect.\n  This defaults to `10`, unless a `ssh_timeout` is set.\n\n- `ssh_bastion_host` (string) - A bastion host to use for the actual SSH connection.\n\n- `ssh_bastion_port` (int) - The port of the bastion host. Defaults to `22`.\n\n- `ssh_bastion_agent_auth` (bool) - If `true`, the local SSH agent will be used to authenticate with the\n  bastion host. Defaults to `false`.\n\n- `ssh_bastion_username` (string) - The username to connect to the bastion host.\n\n- `ssh_bastion_password` (string) - The password to use to authenticate with the bastion host.\n\n- `ssh_bastion_interactive` (bool) - If `true`, the keyboard-interactive used to authenticate with bastion host.\n\n- `ssh_bastion_private_key_file` (string) - Path to a PEM encoded private key file to use to authenticate with the\n  bastion host. The `~` can be used in path and will be expanded to the\n  home directory of current user.\n\n- `ssh_bastion_certificate_file` (string) - Path to user certificate used to authenticate with bastion host.\n  The `~` can be used in path and will be expanded to the\n  home directory of current user.\n\n- `ssh_file_transfer_method` (string) - `scp` or `sftp` - How to transfer files, Secure copy (default) or SSH\n  File Transfer Protocol.\n  \n  **NOTE**: Guests using Windows with Win32-OpenSSH v9.1.0.0p1-Beta, scp\n  (the default protocol for copying data) returns a a non-zero error code since the MOTW\n  cannot be set, which cause any file transfer to fail. As a workaround you can override the transfer protocol\n  with SFTP instead `ssh_file_transfer_protocol = \"sftp\"`.\n\n- `ssh_proxy_host` (string) - A SOCKS proxy host to use for SSH connection\n\n- `ssh_proxy_port` (int) - A port of the SOCKS proxy. Defaults to `1080`.\n\n- `ssh_proxy_username` (string) - The optional username to authenticate with the proxy server.\n\n- `ssh_proxy_password` (string) - The optional password to use to authenticate with the proxy server.\n\n- `ssh_keep_alive_interval` (duration string | ex: \"1h5m2s\") - How often to send \"keep alive\" messages to the server. Set to a negative\n  value (`-1s`) to disable. Example value: `10s`. Defaults to `5s`.\n\n- `ssh_read_write_timeout` (duration string | ex: \"1h5m2s\") - The amount of time to wait for a remote command to end. This might be\n  useful if, for example, packer hangs on a connection after a reboot.\n  Example: `5m`. Disabled by default.\n\n- `ssh_remote_tunnels` ([]string) - \n\n- `ssh_local_tunnels` ([]string) - \n\n<!-- End of code generated from the comments of the SSH struct in communicator/config.go; -->\n\n\n- `ssh_private_key_file` (string) - Path to a PEM encoded private key file to use to authenticate with SSH.\n  The `~` can be used in path and will be expanded to the home directory\n  of current user.\n\n\n## Optional WinRM fields:\n\n<!-- Code generated from the comments of the WinRM struct in communicator/config.go; DO NOT EDIT MANUALLY -->\n\n- `winrm_username` (string) - The username to use to connect to WinRM.\n\n- `winrm_password` (string) - The password to use to connect to WinRM.\n\n- `winrm_host` (string) - The address for WinRM to connect to.\n  \n  NOTE: If using an Amazon EBS builder, you can specify the interface\n  WinRM connects to via\n  [`ssh_interface`](/packer/integrations/hashicorp/amazon/latest/components/builder/ebs#ssh_interface)\n\n- `winrm_no_proxy` (bool) - Setting this to `true` adds the remote\n  `host:port` to the `NO_PROXY` environment variable. This has the effect of\n  bypassing any configured proxies when connecting to the remote host.\n  Default to `false`.\n\n- `winrm_port` (int) - The WinRM port to connect to. This defaults to `5985` for plain\n  unencrypted connection and `5986` for SSL when `winrm_use_ssl` is set to\n  true.\n\n- `winrm_timeout` (duration string | ex: \"1h5m2s\") - The amount of time to wait for WinRM to become available.

Further reading for remote connection authentication can be found\n  [here](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa384295(v=vs.85).aspx).\n\n<!-- End of code generated from the comments of the WinRM struct in communicator/config.go; -->\n\n\n## Working With Clusters And Hosts\n\n### Standalone Hosts\n\nOnly use the `host` option. Optionally specify a `resource_pool`:\n\n**JSON**\n\n```json\n\"host\": \"esxi-1.vsphere65.test\",\n\"resource_pool\": \"pool1\",\n```\n\n**HCL2**\n\n```hcl\nhost = \"\"esxi-1.vsphere65.test\"\"\nresource_pool = \"pool1\"\n```\n\n\n### Clusters Without DRS\n\nUse the `cluster` and `host`parameters:\n\n**JSON**\n\n```json\n\"cluster\": \"cluster1\",\n\"host\": \"esxi-2.vsphere65.test\",\n```\n\n**HCL2**\n\n```hcl\ncluster = \"cluster1\"\nhost = \"esxi-2.vsphere65.test\"\n```\n\n\n### Clusters With DRS\n\nOnly use the `cluster` option. Optionally specify a `resource_pool`:\n\n**JSON**\n\n```json\n\"cluster\": \"cluster2\",\n\"resource_pool\": \"pool1\",\n```\n\n**HCL2**\n\n```hcl\ncluster = \"cluster2\"\nresource_pool = \"pool1\"\n```\n\n\n## Required vSphere Privileges\n\nIt is recommended to create a custom vSphere role with the required privileges to integrate Packer with vSphere. Accounts or groups can be added to the role to ensure that Packer has **_the least privileged_** access to the infrastructure. For example, a named service account (_e.g._ svc-packer-vsphere@example.com). \n\nClone the default **Read-Only** vSphere role and add the following privileges, which are based on the capabilities of the `vsphere-iso` plugin:\n\nCategory        | Privilege                                           | Reference\n----------------|-----------------------------------------------------|---------\nContent Library | Add library item                                    | `ContentLibrary.AddLibraryItem`\n ...            | Update Library Item                                 | `ContentLibrary.UpdateLibraryItem`\nDatastore       | Allocate space                                      | `Datastore.AllocateSpace`\n...             | Browse datastore                                    | `Datastore.Browse`\n...             | Low level file operations                           | `Datastore.Browse`\nNetwork         | Assign network                                      | `Network.Assign`\nResource        | Assign virtual machine to resource pool             | `Resource.AssignVMToPool`\nvApp            | Export                                              | `vApp.Export`\nVirtual Machine | Configuration > Add new disk                        | `VirtualMachine.Config.AddNewDisk`\n...             | Configuration > Add or remove device                | `VirtualMachine.Config.AddRemoveDevice`\n...             | Configuration > Advanced configuration              | `VirtualMachine.Config.AdvancedConfig`\n...             | Configuration > Change CPU count                    | `VirtualMachine.Config.CPUCount`\n...             | Configuration > Change memory                       | `VirtualMachine.Config.Memory`\n...             | Configuration > Change settings                     | `VirtualMachine.Config.Settings`\n...             | Configuration > Change Resource                     | `VirtualMachine.Config.Resource`\n...             | Configuration > Set annotation                      | `VirtualMachine.Config.Annotation`\n...             | Edit Inventory > Create from existing               | `VirtualMachine.Inventory.CreateFromExisting`\n...             | Edit Inventory > Create new                         | `VirtualMachine.Inventory.Create`\n...             | Edit Inventory > Remove                             | `VirtualMachine.Inventory.Delete`\n...             | Interaction > Configure CD media                    | `VirtualMachine.Interact.SetCDMedia`\n...             | Interaction > Configure floppy media                | `VirtualMachine.Interact.SetFloppyMedia`\n...             | Interaction > Connect devices                       | `VirtualMachine.Interact.DeviceConnection`\n...             | Interaction > Inject USB HID scan codes             | `VirtualMachine.Interact.PutUsbScanCodes`\n...             | Interaction > Power off                             | `VirtualMachine.Interact.PowerOff`\n...             | Interaction > Power on                              | `VirtualMachine.Interact.PowerOn`\n...             | Provisioning > Create template from virtual machine | `VirtualMachine.Provisioning.CreateTemplateFromVM`\n...             | Provisioning > Mark as template                     | `VirtualMachine.Provisioning.MarkAsTemplate`\n...             | Provisioning > Mark as virtual machine              | `VirtualMachine.Provisioning.MarkAsVM`\n...             | State > Create snapshot                             | `VirtualMachine.State.CreateSnapshot`\n\nGlobal permissions **[are required](https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-vSphere/7.0/com.vmware.vsphere.security.doc/GUID-03B36057-B38C-479C-BD78-341CD83A0584.html)** for the content library based on the hierarchical inheritance of permissions. Once the custom vSphere role is created, assign **Global Permissions** in vSphere to the accounts or groups used for the Packer to vSphere integration, if using the content library.\n\nFor example:\n\n1. Log in to the vCenter Server at _https://<management_vcenter_server_fqdn>/ui_ as `administrator@vsphere.local`.\n2. Select **Menu** > **Administration**.\n3. In the left pane, select **Access control** > **Global permissions** and click the **Add permissions** icon.\n4. In the **Add permissions** dialog box, enter the service account (_e.g._ svc-packer-vsphere@example.com), select the custom role (_e.g._ Packer to vSphere Integration Role) and the **Propagate to children** check box, and click OK.\n\nIn an environment with many vCenter Server instances, such as management and workload, in enhanced linked-mode, you may wish to further reduce the scope of access across the vSphere infrastructure. For example, if you do not want Packer to have access to the management vCenter Server instance, but only allow access to workload vCenter Server instances:\n\n1. From the **Hosts and clusters** inventory, select management vCenter Server to restrict scope, and click the **Permissions** tab.\n2. Select the service account with the custom role assigned and click the **Change role** icon.\n3.

This is a\n  mostly cosmetic option, since Packer will delete the temporary private\n  key from the host system regardless of whether this is set to true\n  (unless the user has set the `-debug` flag). Defaults to \"false\";\n  currently only works on guests with `sed` installed.\n\n- `ssh_key_exchange_algorithms` ([]string) - If set, Packer will override the value of key exchange (kex) algorithms\n  supported by default by Golang. Acceptable values include:\n  \"curve25519-sha256@libssh.org\", \"ecdh-sha2-nistp256\",\n  \"ecdh-sha2-nistp384\", \"ecdh-sha2-nistp521\",\n  \"diffie-hellman-group14-sha1\", and \"diffie-hellman-group1-sha1\".\n\n- `ssh_certificate_file` (string) - Path to user certificate used to authenticate with SSH.\n  The `~` can be used in path and will be expanded to the\n  home directory of current user.\n\n- `ssh_pty` (bool) - If `true`, a PTY will be requested for the SSH connection. This defaults\n  to `false`.\n\n- `ssh_timeout` (duration string | ex: \"1h5m2s\") - The time to wait for SSH to become available. Packer uses this to\n  determine when the machine has booted so this is usually quite long.\n  Example value: `10m`.\n  This defaults to `5m`, unless `ssh_handshake_attempts` is set.\n\n- `ssh_disable_agent_forwarding` (bool) - If true, SSH agent forwarding will be disabled. Defaults to `false`.\n\n- `ssh_handshake_attempts` (int) - The number of handshakes to attempt with SSH once it can connect.\n  This defaults to `10`, unless a `ssh_timeout` is set.\n\n- `ssh_bastion_host` (string) - A bastion host to use for the actual SSH connection.\n\n- `ssh_bastion_port` (int) - The port of the bastion host. Defaults to `22`.\n\n- `ssh_bastion_agent_auth` (bool) - If `true`, the local SSH agent will be used to authenticate with the\n  bastion host.

The possible values are 'dsa',\n  'ecdsa', 'ed25519', or 'rsa'.\n  \n  NOTE: DSA is deprecated and no longer recognized as secure, please\n  consider other alternatives like RSA or ED25519.\n\n- `temporary_key_pair_bits` (int) - Specifies the number of bits in the key to create. For RSA keys, the\n  minimum size is 1024 bits and the default is 4096 bits. Generally, 3072\n  bits is considered sufficient. DSA keys must be exactly 1024 bits as\n  specified by FIPS 186-2. For ECDSA keys, bits determines the key length\n  by selecting from one of three elliptic curve sizes: 256, 384 or 521\n  bits. Attempting to use bit lengths other than these three values for\n  ECDSA keys will fail. Ed25519 keys have a fixed length and bits will be\n  ignored.\n  \n  NOTE: DSA is deprecated and no longer recognized as secure as specified\n  by FIPS 186-5, please consider other alternatives like RSA or ED25519.\n\n<!-- End of code generated from the comments of the SSHTemporaryKeyPair struct in communicator/config.go; -->\n\n\n<!-- Code generated from the comments of the WinRM struct in communicator/config.go; DO NOT EDIT MANUALLY -->\n\n- `winrm_username` (string) - The username to use to connect to WinRM.\n\n- `winrm_password` (string) - The password to use to connect to WinRM.\n\n- `winrm_host` (string) - The address for WinRM to connect to.\n  \n  NOTE: If using an Amazon EBS builder, you can specify the interface\n  WinRM connects to via\n  [`ssh_interface`](/packer/integrations/hashicorp/amazon/latest/components/builder/ebs#ssh_interface)\n\n- `winrm_no_proxy` (bool) - Setting this to `true` adds the remote\n  `host:port` to the `NO_PROXY` environment variable. This has the effect of\n  bypassing any configured proxies when connecting to the remote host.\n  Default to `false`.\n\n- `winrm_port` (int) - The WinRM port to connect to. This defaults to `5985` for plain\n  unencrypted connection and `5986` for SSL when `winrm_use_ssl` is set to\n  true.\n\n- `winrm_timeout` (duration string | ex: \"1h5m2s\") - The amount of time to wait for WinRM to become available. This defaults\n  to `30m` since setting up a Windows machine generally takes a long time.\n\n- `winrm_use_ssl` (bool) - If `true`, use HTTPS for WinRM.\n\n- `winrm_insecure` (bool) - If `true`, do not check server certificate chain and host name.\n\n- `winrm_use_ntlm` (bool) - If `true`, NTLMv2 authentication (with session security) will be used\n  for WinRM, rather than default (basic authentication), removing the\n  requirement for basic authentication to be enabled within the target\n  guest. Further reading for remote connection authentication can be found\n  [here](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa384295(v=vs.85).aspx).\n\n<!-- End of code generated from the comments of the WinRM struct in communicator/config.go; -->\n\n\n## Deprovisioning Tasks\n\nIf you would like to clean up the VM after the build is complete, you could use the Ansible\nprovisioner to run the following tasks to delete machine-specific files and data.\n\n**HCL2**\n\n```hcl\nbuild {\n  sources = [\"source.vsphere-supervisor.vm\"]\n\n  provisioner \"ansible\" {\n    playbook_file = \"cleanup-playbook.yml\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\n**JSON**\n\n```json\n{\n  \"builders\": [\n    {\n      \"type\": \"vsphere-supervisor\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"provisioners\": [\n    {\n      \"type\": \"ansible\",\n      \"playbook_file\": \"./cleanup-playbook.yml\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\n\nContent of `cleanup-playbook.yml`:\n\n```yaml\n---\n# cleanup-playbook.yml\n- name: Clean up source VM\n  hosts: default\n  become: true\n  tasks:\n    -
