While the `json` format is still supported, but certain new features, such as `packer init` works only in newer HCL2 format.\nIf you are using `json` config templates, please consider upgrading them using the packer built-in command:\n\n```sh\n$ packer hcl2_upgrade example.json\nSuccessfully created example.json.pkr.hcl\n```\n","created_at":"2024-01-02T13:27:38.097Z","updated_at":"2024-01-02T13:27:38.097Z","components":[{"id":"4d3c1c34-6a2e-4324-b311-c366a3873f2c","integration_release_id":"906b8792-e8c0-4dbb-a213-e43eda8084ac","component_id":"36076511-3ced-4faf-addf-101fce0405ff","readme":"\nType: `upcloud`\n\nThe upcloud builder is used to generate storage templates on UpCloud.\n\n<!-- Builder Configuration Fields -->\n\n### Required\n\n<!-- Code generated from the comments of the Config struct in builder/upcloud/config.go; DO NOT EDIT MANUALLY -->\n\n- `username` (string) - The username to use when interfacing with the UpCloud API.\n\n- `password` (string) - The password to use when interfacing with the UpCloud API.\n\n- `zone` (string) - The zone in which the server and template should be created (e.g. nl-ams1).\n\n- `storage_uuid` (string) - The UUID of the storage you want to use as a template when creating the server.\n  \n  Optionally use `storage_name` parameter to find matching storage\n\n<!-- End of code generated from the comments of the Config struct in builder/upcloud/config.go; -->\n\n\n<!--\n  Optional Configuration Fields\n\n  Configuration options that are not required or have reasonable defaults\n  should be listed under the optionals section.

You can overwrite variables using command line argumen `-var`:\n```sh\n$ packer build -var=\"ssh_public_key=/some/other/path/id_rsa.pub\"\n```\n\n#### Network interfaces\nThis template uses `network_interfaces` to define network interfaces to be used during the creation of the server for building the packer image.\n```hcl\npacker {\n  required_plugins {\n    upcloud = {\n      version = \">=v1.0.0\"\n      source  = \"github.com/UpCloudLtd/upcloud\"\n    }\n  }\n}\n\nvariable \"username\" {\n  type        = string\n  description = \"UpCloud API username\"\n  default     = \"${env(\"UPCLOUD_USERNAME\")}\"\n}\n\nvariable \"password\" {\n  type        = string\n  description = \"UpCloud API password\"\n  default     = \"${env(\"UPCLOUD_PASSWORD\")}\"\n  sensitive   = true\n}\n\nvariable \"ssh_public_key\" {\n  type        = string\n  description = \"Path to your SSH public key file\"\n  default     = \"~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub\"\n}\n\nsource \"upcloud\" \"test\" {\n  username        = \"${var.username}\"\n  password        = \"${var.password}\"\n  zone            = \"nl-ams1\"\n  storage_name    = \"ubuntu server 20.04\"\n  template_prefix = \"ubuntu-server\"\n\n  network_interfaces {\n    ip_addresses {\n      family = \"IPv4\"\n    }\n    type = \"public\"\n  }\n\n  network_interfaces {\n    ip_addresses {\n      family = \"IPv4\"\n    }\n    type = \"utility\"\n  }\n}\n\nbuild {\n  sources = [\"source.upcloud.test\"]\n\n  provisioner \"shell\" {\n    inline = [\n      \"apt-get update\",\n      \"apt-get upgrade -y\",\n      \"echo '${file(var.ssh_public_key)}' | tee /root/.ssh/authorized_keys\"\n    ]\n  }\n}\n\n```\n\n#### IPv6 network interfaces\n```hcl\npacker {\n  required_plugins {\n    upcloud = {\n      version = \">=v1.0.0\"\n      source  = \"github.com/UpCloudLtd/upcloud\"\n    }\n  }\n}\n\nvariable \"username\" {\n  type        = string\n  description = \"UpCloud API username\"\n  default     = \"${env(\"UPCLOUD_USERNAME\")}\"\n}\n\nvariable \"password\" {\n  type        = string\n  description = \"UpCloud API password\"\n  default     = \"${env(\"UPCLOUD_PASSWORD\")}\"\n  sensitive   = true\n}\n\nvariable \"ssh_public_key\" {\n  type        = string\n  description = \"Path to your SSH public key file\"\n  default     = \"~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub\"\n}\n\nsource \"upcloud\" \"test\" {\n  username        = \"${var.username}\"\n  password        = \"${var.password}\"\n  zone            = \"fi-hel1\"\n  storage_name    = \"Debian GNU/Linux 11 (Bullseye)\"\n  template_prefix = \"debian11\"\n  network_interfaces {\n    ip_addresses {\n      family = \"IPv6\"\n    }\n    type = \"public\"\n  }\n  communicator = \"ssh\"\n\n  #

Multiple examples\n  can be provided to highlight various build configurations.\n\n-->\n### Example Usage\n\nHere is a sample template, which you can also find in the [example](https://github.com/UpCloudLtd/packer-plugin-upcloud/tree/main/example) directory.\nIt reads your UpCloud API credentials from the environment variables, creates an Ubuntu 20.04 LTS server in the `nl-ams1` region and authorizes root user to loggin with your public SSH key.\n\n```hcl\npacker {\n  required_plugins {\n    upcloud = {\n      version = \">=v1.0.0\"\n      source  = \"github.com/UpCloudLtd/upcloud\"\n    }\n  }\n}\n\nvariable \"username\" {\n  type        = string\n  description = \"UpCloud API username\"\n  default     = \"${env(\"UPCLOUD_USERNAME\")}\"\n}\n\nvariable \"password\" {\n  type        = string\n  description = \"UpCloud API password\"\n  default     = \"${env(\"UPCLOUD_PASSWORD\")}\"\n  sensitive   = true\n}\n\nvariable \"ssh_public_key\" {\n  type        = string\n  description = \"Path to your SSH public key file\"\n  default     = \"~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub\"\n}\n\nsource \"upcloud\" \"test\" {\n  username        = \"${var.username}\"\n  password        = \"${var.password}\"\n  zone            = \"nl-ams1\"\n  storage_name    = \"ubuntu server 20.04\"\n  template_prefix = \"ubuntu-server\"\n}\n\nbuild {\n  sources = [\"source.upcloud.test\"]\n\n  provisioner \"shell\" {\n    inline = [\n      \"apt-get update\",\n      \"apt-get upgrade -y\",\n      \"echo '${file(var.ssh_public_key)}' | tee /root/.ssh/authorized_keys\"\n    ]\n  }\n}\n\n```\n\nConfiguration reads your SSH public key from the default location `~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub`. You can overwrite variables using command line argumen `-var`:\n```sh\n$ packer build -var=\"ssh_public_key=/some/other/path/id_rsa.pub\"\n```\n\n#### Network interfaces\nThis template uses `network_interfaces` to define network interfaces to be used during the creation of the server for building the packer image.\n```hcl\npacker {\n  required_plugins {\n    upcloud = {\n      version = \">=v1.0.0\"\n      source  = \"github.com/UpCloudLtd/upcloud\"\n    }\n  }\n}\n\nvariable \"username\" {\n  type        = string\n  description = \"UpCloud API username\"\n  default     = \"${env(\"UPCLOUD_USERNAME\")}\"\n}\n\nvariable \"password\" {\n  type        = string\n  description = \"UpCloud API password\"\n  default     = \"${env(\"UPCLOUD_PASSWORD\")}\"\n  sensitive   = true\n}\n\nvariable \"ssh_public_key\" {\n  type        = string\n  description = \"Path to your SSH public key file\"\n  default     = \"~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub\"\n}\n\nsource \"upcloud\" \"test\" {\n  username        = \"${var.username}\"\n  password        = \"${var.password}\"\n  zone            = \"nl-ams1\"\n  storage_name    = \"ubuntu server 20.04\"\n  template_prefix = \"ubuntu-server\"\n\n  network_interfaces {\n    ip_addresses {\n      family = \"IPv4\"\n    }\n    type = \"public\"\n  }\n\n  network_interfaces {\n    ip_addresses {\n      family = \"IPv4\"\n    }\n    type = \"utility\"\n  }\n}\n\nbuild {\n  sources = [\"source.upcloud.test\"]\n\n  provisioner \"shell\" {\n    inline = [\n      \"apt-get update\",\n      \"apt-get upgrade -y\",\n      \"echo '${file(var.ssh_public_key)}' | tee /root/.ssh/authorized_keys\"\n    ]\n  }\n}\n\n```\n\n#### IPv6 network interfaces\n```hcl\npacker {\n  required_plugins {\n    upcloud = {\n      version = \">=v1.0.0\"\n      source  = \"github.com/UpCloudLtd/upcloud\"\n    }\n  }\n}\n\nvariable \"username\" {\n  type        = string\n  description = \"UpCloud API username\"\n  default     = \"${env(\"UPCLOUD_USERNAME\")}\"\n}\n\nvariable \"password\" {\n  type        = string\n  description = \"UpCloud API password\"\n  default     = \"${env(\"UPCLOUD_PASSWORD\")}\"\n  sensitive   = true\n}\n\nvariable \"ssh_public_key\" {\n  type        = string\n  description = \"Path to your SSH public key file\"\n  default     = \"~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub\"\n}\n\nsource \"upcloud\" \"test\" {\n  username        = \"${var.username}\"\n  password        = \"${var.password}\"\n  zone            = \"fi-hel1\"\n  storage_name    = \"Debian GNU/Linux 11 (Bullseye)\"\n  template_prefix = \"debian11\"\n  network_interfaces {\n    ip_addresses {\n      family = \"IPv6\"\n    }\n    type = \"public\"\n  }\n  communicator = \"ssh\"\n\n  #
